    "paragraph": "Zinc molybdate phosphors doped with Tm 3+ and Yb 3+ ions, ZnMoO 4 :Tm 3+ ,Yb 3+ , were prepared by a hydrothermal (HT) process. In a typical hydrothermal reaction, a 10 mM mixture of Zn/Yb/Tm (Zn(NO 3 ) 2 4H 2 O/Yb(NO 3 ) 3 5H 2 O/Tm(NO 3 )5H 2 O) in distilled water was prepared in a beaker by constant stirring with a magnetic stirrer. In the above solution, 10 mM cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was added and stirred for about 1 hour to obtain a transparent solution. The amount of CTAB was fixed to adjust the ratio of metal ions to CTAB uniformly such that all the metal ions get properly capped by CTAB. In a separate beaker, 10 mM (NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 4H 2 O was prepared in distilled water and added to the above solution drop by drop. The pH of the resulting solution was adjusted to about 9 using aqueous ammonia solution. Then, 30 mL of the colloidal suspension obtained above was poured into a 50 mL Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and kept at 180 1C for various time periods. In the case of alkali metal ion substituted samples, an appropriate amount of MNO 3 (M = Li, Na, K, Rb) was added into the Zn solution before mixing with the Mo-solution.\nThe solid obtained was centrifuged, washed multiple times with distilled water followed by ethanol and freeze dried for 12 hours.\nThe powder sample was further calcined at various temperatures from 500 1Cto8001C for 3 h to get the final highly crystalline oxide phosphor. For comparison, ZnMoO 4 :Tm 3+ ,Yb 3+ samples were also prepared by a solid-state reaction method. In the solid-state reaction, analytical grade ZnCO 3 , MoO 3 ,Yb 2 O 3 ,Tm 2 O 3 and M 2 CO 3 (M = Li, Na, K, Rb) were mixed thoroughly with the help of ethanol using a mortar and pestle, dried in air and calcined at 650 1C for 3 h.",

Density, molar volume and Vickers microhardness of the prepared glasses were measured. Infrared (IR) and UV–visible spectroscopic techniques were used for structural studies of these glasses. Density as well as the microhardness increase systematically and, conversely, the molar volume decreases with increasing the lead oxide content. This behavior can be explained by the correlation with the glass structure. Increasing the lead oxide content (C20 mol%) increases the network former PbO 4 groups which can play an important role in increasing the connectivity and compactness of the glass matrix via increasing the cross-linking with the other constituent silicate and bismuthate structural units. The increased compactness may explain, in turn, the increase of the density and microhardness. IR spectra reinforce the idea that bismuth participates in the glassy network predominantly as BiO 6 octahedral structural units.\nUV–VIS optical absorption spectra revealed UV-charge transfer absorption bands related to the contribution of Pb 2? ions in the region 350–385 nm; in addition to the extrinsic absorption of trace iron impurities in the range 220–290 nm. In the visible region, three optical bands in the ranges 415–435, 605–650 and 880–890 nm were correlated with the contribution of electronic transitions in Bi 3? ions. Calculation of the optical mobility gap and the width of the energy tail of glass from the UV–VIS absorption indicated a slight increase followed by a decrease in their values. The behavior change occurred at the glass in which PbO content is 20 mol% where lead oxide starts to participate into the glassy matrix as a network former. The combination of analytical FTIR and UV– visible spectroscopy provided a consistent picture of structure–property relations in this glass system.\n1 Introduction Heavy metal glasses based on Bi 2 O 3 and PbO have received much interest because of their thermal stability [1] and interesting properties. These glasses exhibit high thirdorder nonlinear optical susceptibility which makes them useful for ultra-fast optical switches, optic and optoelectronic devices [2, 3]. They are promising materials for technological applications such as upconverting phosphors, new laser materials, and optical waveguides due to their low phonon energy [3, 4]. They have special applications in the area of thermal and mechanical sensors, reﬂecting windows, low-loss ﬁber optic and infrared (IR)-transmitting materials (because of their long infrared cut-off wavelengths in excess of 9 lm) [5, 6]. They are also used to produce, after appropriate annealing, high temperature superconductors with controllable microstructure [7, 8].\nBismuthate glasses are attractive to researchers because of their unique structural characteristics, which result from coordination changes in bismuth. Despite the fact that Bi 2 O 3 is not a conventional glass former, due to its high polarizability and small ﬁeld strength of Bi 3? ions, in the presence of conventional glass formers (such as SiO 2 , B 2 O 3 ,P 2 O 5 , GeO 2 , etc.), it may build a glass network of [BiO n ](n = 3, 6) pyramids [1, 9–12]. However, the structural role played by Bi 2 O 3 in glasses is still complicated and poorly understood. This is because the [BiO n ] S. M. Abo-Naf (&)  R. L. Elwan  M. A.

It is well known that glasses containing PbO exhibit high refractive indices and low crystallization tendency [13]. They are also low melting glasses with low glass transition temperatures. It has been found that lead and bismuth oxides do not form glasses by themselves and glasses in the system Bi 2 O 3 –PbO can be obtained only with the roller technique at cooling rates in the range 10 3 –10 4 K/s [2]. We have observed that the appropriate addition of SiO 2 in the system Bi 2 O 3 –PbO improves dramatically the glass forming ability in this ternary system. To our knowledge, these glasses have not been extensively studied and reported.\nThe objective of the present work is the characterization of SiO 2 –PbO–Bi 2 O 3 glasses using density and Vickers microhardness measurements, FTIR and UV–visible spectroscopy.\n2 Experimental 2.1 Glass preparation SiO 2 –PbO–Bi 2 O 3 glasses having the composition of 35SiO 2 –xPbO–(65 - x)Bi 2 O 3 (where x = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 35, 45; in mol%) were prepared using the conventional melting and annealing method. The starting materials used in the present study were powders of analytical reagent grade of SiO 2 ,Pb 3 O 4 and Bi 2 O 3 , respectively. Well mixed powders containing appropriate amounts of the raw materials were melted in a platinum crucible in an electric furnace at 900–950° C for 30 min. in air. The glass formed by quenching the melt on a preheated stainless-steel mold was immediately transferred to another mufﬂe furnace where it was annealed at about 300 °C for 1 h. Then, the mufﬂe was switched off and the temperature decreased to room temperature with a rate 25 °C/h.",

    "paragraph": "Ca 1-x Sr x TiO 3 (x = 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 0.9) bulk ceramics samples were prepared through a mixed oxide solid state sintering route. All the samples were characterized using synchrotron X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and vector network analyzer. Structural analysis revealed structural phase transition from orthorhombic (Pbnm)to tetragonal (I4/mcm)atx [ 0.5, consistent with the present Raman spectroscopy results. There was no evidence of orthorhombic Bmmb symmetry in the range x = 0.1–0.9.\nRelative permittivity varied from 148 to 241, quality factor from 7,427 to 1,487 GHz and temperature coefﬁcient of resonance frequency from ?320 to ?479 ppm/°C with an increase in x from 0.1 to 0.9.\n1 Introduction The idea of using a solid state dielectric material as a resonator in wireless telecommunication devices, satellite broadcasting equipment and mobiles handsets, was ﬁrst ﬂoated by Richtmyer in 1939 [1]. The suitability of a material to be used in microwave dielectric resonators depends on three important characteristics. A high dielectric constant (e r ) is required for miniaturization of the component, a high quality factor (Q 9 f) is needed for ﬁne tunability and near zero temperature coefﬁcient of resonant frequency (s f ) for temperature stability [2]. In general, materials don’t exhibit all these properties simultaneously; however, a number of materials have the ability to host different cations to form new compounds to enhance the desired properties and suppress the unwanted ones [1].\nPerovskite structured materials like CaTiO 3 ,BaTiO 3 and SrTiO 3 have been studied for their potential applications as dielectric resonators. Among these, CaTiO 3 is a natural perovskite mineral discoveredbyGustavRosein1839[3]and was named perovskite after the name of well-known mineralogist Perovskii [4, 5]. CaTiO 3 has an orthorhombic (Pbnm) structure at room temperature [6] and has been reported to exhibit reasonable e r (*160) and Q 9 f (*7,000 GHz); however, its s f (*850 ppm/°C) is too high for microwave dielectric applications [7]. In order to tailor its microwave dielectric properties via structural variations, it can be doped with a number of cations. Doping trivalent cations (like La 3? , Nd 3? ,Sm 3? ,Y 3? ,Pr 3? ) on the A-site of the CaTiO 3 unit cell creates a number of vacancies to neutralize charge [3]. The creation of these vacancies leads to doubling of the unit cell which results in structural distortion [8]. Similarly, SrTiO 3 (a man-made perovskite material) has attracted increased research interest due to its applications in luminescence and data storage devices, and as an anode material in fuel cells [9]. SrTiO 3 has a cubic (Pm  3m) structure with lattice constant a = 3.905 A ˚ at room temperature [10, 11]ande r = 300, Q 9 f = 3,300 and a high s f = 1,650 [7]. The effect of Sr-doping in CaTiO 3 has been reported previously. For example, Qin et al. [12]used Raman spectroscopy and reported structural phase transition in Ca 1-x Sr x TiO 3 from orthorhombic (Pbnm) to tetragonal (I4/mcm)atx = 0.65 and then to cubic (Pm  3m)atx = 0.95.\nSimilarly, an XRD study of Ca 1-x Sr x TiO 3 reported an orthorhombic (Pbnm) symmetry at 0.4 C x C 0, orthorhombic (Pbnm/Bmmb) symmetry at x = 0.5, tetragonal (I4/mcm)at M.

The solid solution was reported to exhibit e r * 162–190, s f * ?859–1,650 ppm/°CandQ 9 f * 8,700–2,460.\nIn the present study, results regarding the crystal structure, microstructure and microwave dielectric properties of Ca (1-x) Sr x TiO 3 (x = 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 0.9) ceramics are reported.\n2 Experimental Ca 1-x Sr x TiO 3 (x = 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 0.9) was prepared using CaCO 3 (Alfa Aesar 99.5 %), SrCO 3 (Alfa Aesar 99.99 %) and TiO 2 (Alfa Aesar 99.9 %). Carefully weighed stoichiometric mixtures of initial ingredients were milled in disposable polyvinyl jars with Yt-stabilized ZrO 2 balls as milling media in ethanol for 24 h using bench-top planetary ball mill (QM-3SP2). The slurry was dried overnight, sieved and then calcined at 1,150 °C/4 h using alumina crucibles in air atmosphere in a KSLX 1800 chamber furnace at heating/ cooling rate of 5 °C/min. Calcined powders were re-milled for 24 h to further reduce the particle size and sieved after drying to dissociate agglomerates. Powder samples were pressed into 3–5 mm high and 10 mm diameter pellets at 100 MPa in a uniaxial manual pellet press. The pellets were sintered at 1,350 °C in the same furnace in air atmosphere.\nDensities of the sintered pellets were measured by Archimedean method using a MD-300s high precession densitometer. Detailed structural analyses were performed with synchrotron diffraction data collected at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF), China, at BL15U1 beam line with k = 0.69 A ˚ and a beam spot of area 7.5 9 2.0 lm 2 . A ﬁxed exit and liquid nitrogen cooled double crystal monochromator with two sets of Si crystals [Si (111) and Si (220)] was employed for data collection in nondepressive conﬁguration followed by a toroidal focusing mirror with a horizontal acceptance angle of 2.8 mrad.\nPowder samples were uniformly distributed on an adhesive tape and mounted on a sample holder accordingly. Diffraction patterns of the powder samples were recorded with Multi-Analyses on Radioactive Samples (MARS 345) imaging plate with the sample to detector distance of 207.729 mm. Diffraction patterns obtained in the form of ‘Debye’ rings were converted into one-dimensional X-ray proﬁle versus 2h using FIT2D software [14]. X-ray diffraction data was analyzed using standard computer program ‘RIETICA’. Raman spectroscopy of the samples was performed using a RENISHAW Raman spectrometer in the range of 100–800 cm -1 with Argon ion laser of wavelength 514.5 nm and operating power of 50 mW. A grating of 1,800 lines/mm was used for this purpose. Samples for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were polished, and thermally etched at temperatures 10 % less than the corresponding sintering temperatures for 30 min at a heating/cooling rate of 10 °C/min. Microstructural analysis of samples was performed using a FEI, QUANTA, FEG 650 SEM. Energy dispersive spectroscopy was performed using an INCA, SYNERGY (Oxford) EDS detector. Microwave dielectric properties of the samples were determined using S-parameter network analyzer (Hewlett Packard 8720ES, 50 MHz– 20 GHz) with Hakki and Coleman method [15, 16]. Measurement of Q 9 f was performed at TE 01d resonant mode in reﬂectance whereas e r was measured by TE 011 resonant mode. s f was determined by varying the temperature of the resonator between 20 and 80 °C using Eq. (1) s f ¼ ðf 2  f 1 Þ f 1 ðT 2  T 1 Þ ð1Þ where f 1 and f 2 are the resonant frequencies at temperature T 1 and T 2 respectively.",

Magnesium turnings (99.9%, Acros ), lithium ingot (99.9%, Aldrich), lanthanum chip (99.9%, Aldrich) and bismuth block (99.9%, Alfa) were used as received. Single crystals of La 3 MgBi 5 were initially obtained by the solid-state reaction of magnesium (0.012 g, 0.5 mmol), lanthanum (0.138 g, 1.0 mmol) and bismuth (0.313 g, 1.5 mmol). The mixture was loaded into a niobium tube, arc-welded an d then sealed in an evacuated quartz tube (10 4 Torr). The tube was put into an oven and heated at 980 1C for 2 days, and annealed at 800 1C for 7 days. Afterwards, the reaction tube was allowed to cool at a rate of 0.1 1C/min to the room temperature. Brick-shaped gray crystals of La 3 MgBi 5 were obtained. Single crystals of LaLiBi 2 (brick in shape and gray in color) were obtained in a similar way by using lithium (0.069 g, 1.0 mmol) instead of magnesium. Several single crystals of La 3 MgBi 5 and LaLiBi 2 were analyzed by using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX 9100), and the results indicate that atomic ratios to be 2.8: 1.0: 5.1 for La, Mg, and Bi in La 3 MgBi 5 and 1: 2.2 for La and Bi in LaLiBi 2 , respectively, which are in good agreement with those of the structural reﬁnements. After the determination of single crystal structures, great efforts were subsequently made to synthesize pure phases of La 3 MgBi 5 and LaLiBi 2 .\nThe reactions were carried out in a stoichiometric ratio of the metals, as well as using of an excess of 20% lithium to compensate possibl e loss during arc welding. The sample s were heated at 980 1C for 1 day, quenched in water, and annealing at different temperatures (600, 700, 800, and 850 1C, respectively, for each individual reaction) for 1 month. However, X-ray powder patterns of the resultant products revealed the presence of impurity phases, such as LaBi (Fm3-m), Mg 3 Bi 2 (P3-m1), as well as other unidentiﬁed compounds.

The highest yields of 60% and 70%, for La 3 MgBi 5 and LaLiBi 2 , were obtained by an nealing at 800 and 700 1C, respectively.

Stoichiometric amounts of powders of Y 2 O 3 (Sinopharm, China, analytical grade), MnO 2 (Hunan Huitong Science & Technology Co., Ltd, China, purity[99.4 %), Cr 2 O 3 (Sinopharm, China, purity[99.0 %), CaCO 3 (Sinopharm, China, analytical grade) were taken as the starting reagents. All powders were mixed after weighing in appropriate proportions and then ball-milled in ethanol, using agate ball as milling media, for 8 h. After drying, the powder mixture was then calcined at 1200 °C for 2 h. The calcined powders were hand-milled in mortar for 6 h. Subsequently, the powders were pressed into a disk with 10 mm in diameter and 2 mm in thickness with a uniaxial press at 20 MPa. Cold isostatic pressing at 350 MPa was used to enhance the green densities. The pressed green disks were sintered in a furnace (LHT08/18, Nabertherm, Germany) at 1600 °C for 5 h in ambient air atmosphere. The two opposite sides of the sintered pellets were polished and coated with silver-palladium paste, and then heated at 835 °C for 20 min for metallization. To obtain resistivity at 25 °C, resistances of the sintered pellets were measured in an oil bath at 25 °C with a digital multimeter (Hewlett Packard, 34401A).",

    "paragraph": "The synthesis of Zn 2 SiO 4 :Mn 2+ powder was performed with the HP method using the procedure described below. Aqueous solutions of Zn(NO 3 ) 2 (Kanto Chemical, 99.0%), Mn(NO 3 ) 2 (Wako Chemical, 98.0%), and PGMS were prepared, and urea (Kanto Chemical, 99.0%) or hexamethylene tetramine (HMT, Kanto Chemical, 99.0%) was used as a precipitant. The starting aqueous solutions were dispensed into a 300 mL beaker to achieve a stoichiometric ratio of Zn 1.96 Mn 0.04 SiO 4 , followed by addition of urea or HMT, and the mixture was stirred. As needed, before adding the precipitant, HCl was added to the mixed solution to set the initial pH to 2.5. Distilled water was added to the mixed solution to adjust the total concentration of metal and silicon to 0.1 M (75 mL). The beaker was covered and heated in a water bath to bring the solution temperature to 363 K, and was held for 4 to 24 h and stirred at 400 rpm by a magnetic stirrer equipped with a heating plate to obtain a precipitate. The precipitate was separated by ﬁltration, washed with distilled water, and dried to obtain a precursor. This precursor was annealed at various temperatures for 2 h to obtain a ﬁnal sample. A similar approach was performed using bulk SiO 2 (particle size: 63–270 mm, Kanto Chemical, 99.9%), fumed silica (particle size: 7 nm, Aldrich), or TEOS as the silicon source, and these were compared to samples prepared from PGMS. The samples obtained using PGMS, SiO 2 , fumed silica, and TEOS as silicon sources are hereafter referred to as HP-PGMS, HP-SiO 2 , HP-fs, and HP-TEOS, respectively. The synthesis of the sample by a solid-state reaction (SSR) using ZnO (Kanto Chemical, 99.0%), Mn 3 O 4 (Kojundo Chemical, 99.9%), and SiO 2 powder as starting materials was also performed. Raw materials were weighed in a stoichiometric ratio, then they were thoroughly mixed using ethanol in an agate mortar. The mixture was calcined at 973–1573 K for 2 hours in air. All samples in the present research were heat-treated without addition of any ﬂuxes. The resulting samples were characterized by a powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD; Bruker, D2 PHASER), a scanning electron microscope (SEM; Hitachi, S-4800) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectra analyzer (EDS), and an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscope (ICP-AES; Perkin Elmer, Optima 3300XL). For ICP-AES analysis, samples were dissolved into 10% HF solution, then it was diluted to obtain the proper concentration. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of samples were obtained using a ﬂuorescence spectrometer (Hitachi, F4500). In the PL measurement, the pure sample without dilution was densely stuffed in a hole of a sample holder equipped with a quartz window. The sample holder ﬁlled with the sample was ﬁxed at the same position in a measurement room of the ﬂuorescence spectrometer using a jig for each measurement. Thus, the PL spectra were obtained under the same conditions. The PL spectra of commercial Zn 2 SiO 4 :Mn 2+ phosphors (Nemoto Lumi-Material, G-29 and GYL-D1) were also taken for comparison. Quantum efﬁciencies of the samples were evaluated using a ﬂuorescence spectrometer (Jasco, FP-6500) equipped with an integrating sphere.",
