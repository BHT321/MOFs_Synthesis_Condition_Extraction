First, the mixture was heated at 500 1C for one day in order to decompose H 3 BO 3 and CdCO 3 . Second, the resulting mixture was further heated for one day at 1200 1 C until a transparent and clear melt was formed. Third, the melt was allowed to cool slowly (3 1Ch 1 )to the final crystallization temperature (1100 1C). Finally, the obtained mixture was quenched to room temperature. Colorless, transparent crystals were obtained for structure determination.

The hydrothermal synthesis of layered manganese oxides has now become a focus of great attention, and large number of alkali-metal containing, mixed-metal materials have now been prepared for electrochemical testing; examples include potassium manganese oxides 24 and manganese–vanadium oxides.",

NaTaO 3 has long been recognized as an eﬃcient UV-light photocatalyst for overall water splitting.\n46–57 It has a band gap of 4.0 eV and can be synthesized by solidstate, 46–48,53,56 hydrothermal, 49,52,54,55 sol–gel 50,51 and molten salt methods.\n57 As a first example, Kato and Kudo reported highly efficient splitting of pure water into H 2 and O 2 over the NaTaO 3 photocatalyst. The quantum yield of the NaTaO 3 (0.05 wt% NiO as a co-catalyst) photocatalyst prepared by the solid-state reaction method was 28% for water splitting at 270 nm.\n46–48 In order to increase the surface area of NaTaO 3 bulk particles, many researchers attempted to use other synthetic routes to prepare nano-sized particles as an extension of the study on the NaTaO 3 photocatalyst. Kondo et al. synthesized a colloidal array of NaTaO 3 nanoparticles using threedimensional mesoporous carbon as a template, which was replicated by the colloidal array of silica nanospheres. After burning out the mesoporous carbon matrix, a colloidal array of NaTaO 3 nanoparticles with a size of 20 nm and a surface area of 34 m 2 g 1 was obtained. Compared to non-nanostructured bulk NaTaO 3 particles, the nanostructured NaTaO 3 exhibited more than 3 times higher photocatalytic activity for overall water splitting.\n54 Shortly afterwards, Shi and Li et al. developedafastandfacilemethodfor the preparation of NaTaO 3 nanocrystals via a microwave-assisted hydrothermal process.\n55 An indirect transformation route from Ta 2 O 5 to Na 2 Ta 2 O 6 and to NaTaO 3 was proposed as the main reason for that pure NaTaO 3 could be synthesized in a rather short time (less than 3 h) under mild condition s. The water splitting efficiency of NaTaO 3 nanocrystals prepared by this approach was more than two times higher than that prepared from conventional hydrothermal synthesis. Recently, the nano-sized NaTaO 3 ,prepared by an exo-template method with a crystallite size of about 25 nm, showed an 18 times higher hydrogen evolution rate than NaTaO 3 synthesized by a solid-state reaction method (Fig. 2).\n56 The hydrogen production activity of NaTaO 3 obtained from the exo-template synthesis could be further improved by about 30–40 times by mixing with reduced graphene oxide and using Au as a co-catalyst. However, it did not show the improvement of activity for NaTaO 3 prepared from solid-state reaction under identical conditions.",

Owing to the high crystallization tendency of the melts, high cooling rates (10 4 –10 5 K/s) were applied using the roller-quenching method in order to deﬁne the glass formation region. Only fragmented 1–3 cm ﬂat pieces, about 50–100 lm thick, were produced.

    "paragraph": "The synthesis of Mg 2 Si is challenging for a number of reasons, namely the high afﬁnity of magnesium for oxygen, the high vapor pressure of Mg, the high melting temperature of silicon at 1687 K, and the almost identical melting point of Mg 2 Si at 1358 K and boiling point of Mg at 1363 K.\nAs a consequence, many Mg 2 Si samples exhibit MgO impurities.\n40 Therefore, several different methods in addition to classical ceramic methods have been devised, including the vertical Bridgman method using molten Mg 2 Si, 41 crystal growth from molten Mg 2 Si 1x Ge x , 42 B 2 O 3 ﬂux method, 43 microwave assisted fast synthesis after ball-milling, 44 vacuum plasma spray, 45 a solid-state metathesis reaction of NaSi, MgCl 2 and Na, 46 and liquid encapsulated vertical gradient freezing using a KCl/MgCl 2 eutectic mixture as encapsulant.\n47 Recently, an ‘‘ultrafast self-propagating high-temperature synthesis’’ was developed in which a cylinder of Mg, Si and Sb reacted after ignition within seconds in air to yield Sb-doped Mg 2 Si.\n48 The same authors also prepared other thermoelectrics via this method.\n49 In several of these methods, an excess of magnesium was used to compensate for its vapor loss.",

This method utilized Fe 2 WO 6 prepared at the ﬁrst stage from Fe 2 O 3 and WO 3 , which subsequently reacted with a stoichiometric amount of PbO at the second stage. On heating up to 1110 K a pure perovskite phase of PFW was obtained. The purity of the powder samples was checked from the powder X-ray diffraction patterns obtained with an URD-63 diffractometer using Cu K radiation. The XRD measurements showed that the as prepared sample of PFW formed a single phase powder and that its crystal structure agreed with the previous reports [6–10]. The room temperature XRD pattern could be indexed on the basis of a primitive cubic perovskite unit cell with (a = 3.9778(3) A ˚ ) and, thus without ordering of the Fe and W ions on the octahedral sites. This value is in excellent agreement with the lattice parameter obtained from single crystal data (a = 3.9775(1) A ˚ ) of PFW [11]. There is, however, a slight disagreement with the cell parameters of the ceramic samples where a = 3.9865 and 3.9806 A ˚ , respectively, reported in [15] and .",

The tube was put into an oven and heated at 980 1C for 2 days, and annealed at 800 1C for 7 days. Afterwards, the reaction tube was allowed to cool at a rate of 0.1 1C/min to the room temperature. Brick-shaped gray crystals of La 3 MgBi 5 were obtained. Single crystals of LaLiBi 2 (brick in shape and gray in color) were obtained in a similar way by using lithium (0.069 g, 1.0 mmol) instead of magnesium. Several single crystals of La 3 MgBi 5 and LaLiBi 2 were analyzed by using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX 9100), and the results indicate that atomic ratios to be 2.8: 1.0: 5.1 for La, Mg, and Bi in La 3 MgBi 5 and 1: 2.2 for La and Bi in LaLiBi 2 , respectively, which are in good agreement with those of the structural reﬁnements.

    "paragraph": "The experiments of crystal growth were carried out in a vertical cylindrical electric furnace. The furnace temperature was measured by a Pt-Rh thermocouple and controlled by an FP-21 digital microprocessor temperature programmer-controller. The procedure of crystal growth was as follows: polycrystalline Ga 3 PO 7 was ﬁrst synthesized using a standard solid-state reaction method from 4N pure reagent grade Ga 2 O 3 and analytically pure reagent grade NH 4 H 2 PO 4 , and poured into the liquid mixture of the Li 2 O–3MoO 3 system at 1173 K in a platinum crucible in a vertical furnace. The mass ratio between the solute and solvent is 1:5. Then they were heated up to 1350 K and followed by stirring for 24 h to form a well-proportioned solution. The seed of Ga 3 PO 7 was along the c-orientation. The saturation temperature was determined by observing the growth or dissolution of crystal seeds on the solution surface. After the seed was immersed into the solution, the temperature was continuously lowered at the speed of 0.5–2 K/d from the saturation temperature. During its growth, the crystal was rotated at a rate of 30 rpm. When the growth process ended, the crystal was pulled from the solution surface and cooled to room temperature at a rate of 15 K/h. Finally, the single crystal with a typical size of 18  15  12 mm 3 was obtained after a grown run of approximately 30 days, as shown in Fig. 1.",

The structural analysis is carried out using X-ray diffractometer and their 3D vitalization is simulated using diamond software. The frequency and temperature-dependent dielectric properties of prepared samp les have been measured using inductor capacitor resistor (LCR) meter. The structural analysis conﬁrms that all the prepa red samples have inverse cubic spinel structure. It is also revealed that the crystallite size and lattice parameter decrease with the increasing concentration of lithium (Li ?1 ) ions, it is due to the smaller ionic radii of lithium ions. The comprehensive analysis of frequency, concentration and temperature-dependent dielectric properties of prepared samples is described in this paper. It is observed that the dielectric constant and tangent loss have decreased and conductivity increased as the frequency increases. It is also revealed that the dielectric constant, tangent loss and AC conductivity increase as the concentration of lithium increases due to its lower electronegativity value. Temperature plays a vital role in enhancing the dielectric constant, tangent loss and AC conductivity because the mobility of ions increases as the temperature increases.\n1 Introduction Ferrites are the materials that show both magnetic and electrical features. Usually ferrites have spinel structure with general expression AB 2 O 4 where A and B signiﬁes the metal cation mostly iron [1]. As ferrites have both magnetic and electrical properties, therefore they are extensively used in recording media devices, activators, antenna rods and many other electronic devices and computer apparatus [2].\nInverse spinel ferrites have structural formula (Me 3? ) A [M 2? Me 3? ]BO 4 , where trivalent ions equally ﬁll both A (tetrahedral) and B (octahedral) sites, whereas the divalent anion occupies the octahedral site [3]. Cobalt ferrites have inverse spinel structure, which have outstanding electrical and magnetic characteristics, so they are used in data storage gadgets, biomedical applications and ferroﬂuid technology [4].\nCobalt ferrites have been synthesized by many conventional methods such as sol–gel processing, co-precipitation, hydrothermal process and mechanical alloying [5, 6]. The investigation of doping effect of non-magnetic lithium ions on several properties of cobalt ferrites is innovative in literature survey. Solid solution formation Li x Co 1-x Fe 2 O 4 , where x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1 involves the replacement of Co 2? cation by two Li ? ions, one of which substitutes directly onto the Co octahedral, while the other enters interstitial tetrahedr ons sites which results in high conductivity due to access Li ? ions for this materials.\nWhen Co cations are replaced with ones of lower charge, i.e., Li ? , vacancies are often introduced into anions sublattice, in order to preserve electro-neutrality [7].\nSelim worked on lithium-dope d cobalt ferrites, which were produced by solid–solid interaction. The electrical and dielectric properties were studied by using DC and AC & Saﬁa Anjum saﬁa_anjum@hotmail.com 1 Department of Physics, Lahore College for Women University, Lahore, Pakistan 2 University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan 123 Appl. Phys. A (2017) 123:554 DOI 10.1007/s00339-017-1169-x   \ninstruments. Due to increase in Li 2 O concentration ferrites formation increased as a result of rise in mobility of the reacting species as well as resistivity increases [8]. Gul observed the electrical properties of aluminium-doped cobalt ferrites CoFe 2-x Al x O 4 (x = 0, 0.25, 0.50) prepared by sol–gel route. Due to the increasing content of Al 3? ions, the DC electrical resistivity and dielectric constant decreases [9]. R.C. Kambale synthesized cobalt-doped nickel ferrites Ni 1-x Co x Fe 2 O 4 having x = 0–0.8 by applying standard ceramic method. Electrical DC resistivity measurements conﬁrmed that resistivity decreases with the increasing content of cobalt. Such type of ferri tes is particularly used in magnetic recording media application [10].\nIn this study, lithium-substituted cobalt ferrites Li x Co 1-x Fe 2 O 4 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1) have been made using simple ball milli ng route and explore the inﬂuence of Li ?1 -substituted cobalt ferrites on structural and dielectric properties. Lithium-doped cobalt ferrites have abundant use in recording media gadgets, gas sensing, high-frequency telecommunication devices and microwave applications [11].\n2 Experimental setup The lithium-substituted cobalt ferrite Li x Co 1-x Fe 2 O 4 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1) prepared using powder metallurgy route. The LiO, CoO and Fe 2 O 3 powders of 4 N purity are the starting precursor materials, weighing in a speciﬁc ratio to fulﬁll the stoichiometry. These powders are mixed and then placed in a Fritsch Pulverisette ball milling machine for 2 h at 300 rpm for grinding. Then the powder is placed in a crucible for annealing in a heating element furnace at 1150 C for 2 h. The solid form of powder is then reground by mortar and pestle to make a uniform and homogeneous powder.\nThe green compact of 1.2 cm are prepared from ﬁne powder in Carver pellet press by applying pressure of 5000 psi and then sintered at 900  for 1 h in furnace. The block diagram of powder metallurgy process is shown in Fig. 1.",

The sample of LiNi 0.9-x Co 0.1 Sn x O 2 (x=0.02) not only shows good cycle performance but also exhibits an excellent discharge capacity of 188 mAh/g in the first cycle at a current densi ty of 100 mA/g in the voltage range of 3.0– 4.3 V. The tin doping results in reducing the resistanc e and increasing conductivity of LiNi 0.9-x Co 0.1 Sn x O 2 . This composite oxide is promising as cathode material for lithiumion battery.\nKeywords Cathode materials .\nLithium-ion batteries .\nLiNi 0.9 Co 0.1 O 2 .\nTin doping Introduction Lithium-ion batteries have been studied for the past several decades due to their high energy density and capacity. The cycle life and capacity of the lithium-ion cells critically depend on the structural and electrochemical properties of the cathode materials. Currently, the research on the cathode for lithium-ion batteries has been focused on three materials (LiCoO 2 ,LiNiO 2 and LiMn 2 O 4 )andtheir derivatives [1–6]. Generally, LiCoO 2 is used as commercial cathode materials due to its high reversibility, reasonable rate capacity and easy preparation, but it suffers from high cost and the relatively high toxicity of cobalt. LiNiO 2 is a more attractive material than LiCoO 2 because of its low cost and possibility of higher rechargeable capacity [7].\nNevertheless, stoichiometric LiNiO 2 is difficult to be obtained because of the loss of lithium from the host structure due to the high vapor pressure of lithium at high sintering temperature. Therefore, much research has been undertaken to search for new cathode materials to overcome these shortcomings.\nIn recent years, the lithium nickel cobalt mixed oxides have played an important role in the field of lithium-ion batteries [8, 9]. The solid solution, LiNi 1-y Co y O 2 (0<y<1) is being closely scrutinized as a possible substitute for LiCoO 2 because it has both advantages of LiNiO 2 and LiCoO 2 , which is based on the fact that LiNiO 2 and LiCoO 2 have the same layered α-NaFeO 2 -type structure [10, 11]. Among them, LiNi 0.90 Co 0.10 O 2 appears to be much more promising.\nElements such as Fe, Al, Mn, and Y have been used for partial substitution of Ni or Co to further enhance the electrochemical performance of the cathode materials [12–14]. The doped materials show better structural stability and cycling behavior than undoped ones.\nIn this study, for the first time, tin-doped LiNi 0.9 Co 0.1 O 2 cathode material is synthesized by the rheological phase reaction method, which does not need troublesome processes such as pelletizing, washing, stirring, and repeated heat treatment [15]. The effects of tin doping on the structure and electrochemical properties are discussed in detail.\nExperimental LiNi 0.9-x Co 0.1 Sn x O 2 (x=0.00, 0.02, and 0.03) were synthesized by the rheologi ca l phas e reactio n met hod [15].\nLiOH·H 2 O, Ni(OH) 2 ,Co 2 O 3 , and SnO 2 were mixed fully in the stoichiometric molar ratio by grinding.

    "paragraph": "Ca 1-x Sr x TiO 3 (x = 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 0.9) bulk ceramics samples were prepared through a mixed oxide solid state sintering route. All the samples were characterized using synchrotron X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and vector network analyzer. Structural analysis revealed structural phase transition from orthorhombic (Pbnm)to tetragonal (I4/mcm)atx [ 0.5, consistent with the present Raman spectroscopy results. There was no evidence of orthorhombic Bmmb symmetry in the range x = 0.1–0.9.\nRelative permittivity varied from 148 to 241, quality factor from 7,427 to 1,487 GHz and temperature coefﬁcient of resonance frequency from ?320 to ?479 ppm/°C with an increase in x from 0.1 to 0.9.\n1 Introduction The idea of using a solid state dielectric material as a resonator in wireless telecommunication devices, satellite broadcasting equipment and mobiles handsets, was ﬁrst ﬂoated by Richtmyer in 1939 [1]. The suitability of a material to be used in microwave dielectric resonators depends on three important characteristics. A high dielectric constant (e r ) is required for miniaturization of the component, a high quality factor (Q 9 f) is needed for ﬁne tunability and near zero temperature coefﬁcient of resonant frequency (s f ) for temperature stability [2]. In general, materials don’t exhibit all these properties simultaneously; however, a number of materials have the ability to host different cations to form new compounds to enhance the desired properties and suppress the unwanted ones [1].\nPerovskite structured materials like CaTiO 3 ,BaTiO 3 and SrTiO 3 have been studied for their potential applications as dielectric resonators. Among these, CaTiO 3 is a natural perovskite mineral discoveredbyGustavRosein1839[3]and was named perovskite after the name of well-known mineralogist Perovskii [4, 5]. CaTiO 3 has an orthorhombic (Pbnm) structure at room temperature [6] and has been reported to exhibit reasonable e r (*160) and Q 9 f (*7,000 GHz); however, its s f (*850 ppm/°C) is too high for microwave dielectric applications [7]. In order to tailor its microwave dielectric properties via structural variations, it can be doped with a number of cations. Doping trivalent cations (like La 3? , Nd 3? ,Sm 3? ,Y 3? ,Pr 3? ) on the A-site of the CaTiO 3 unit cell creates a number of vacancies to neutralize charge [3]. The creation of these vacancies leads to doubling of the unit cell which results in structural distortion [8]. Similarly, SrTiO 3 (a man-made perovskite material) has attracted increased research interest due to its applications in luminescence and data storage devices, and as an anode material in fuel cells [9]. SrTiO 3 has a cubic (Pm  3m) structure with lattice constant a = 3.905 A ˚ at room temperature [10, 11]ande r = 300, Q 9 f = 3,300 and a high s f = 1,650 [7]. The effect of Sr-doping in CaTiO 3 has been reported previously. For example, Qin et al. [12]used Raman spectroscopy and reported structural phase transition in Ca 1-x Sr x TiO 3 from orthorhombic (Pbnm) to tetragonal (I4/mcm)atx = 0.65 and then to cubic (Pm  3m)atx = 0.95.\nSimilarly, an XRD study of Ca 1-x Sr x TiO 3 reported an orthorhombic (Pbnm) symmetry at 0.4 C x C 0, orthorhombic (Pbnm/Bmmb) symmetry at x = 0.5, tetragonal (I4/mcm)at M.

The solid solution was reported to exhibit e r * 162–190, s f * ?859–1,650 ppm/°CandQ 9 f * 8,700–2,460.\nIn the present study, results regarding the crystal structure, microstructure and microwave dielectric properties of Ca (1-x) Sr x TiO 3 (x = 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 0.9) ceramics are reported.\n2 Experimental Ca 1-x Sr x TiO 3 (x = 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 0.9) was prepared using CaCO 3 (Alfa Aesar 99.5 %), SrCO 3 (Alfa Aesar 99.99 %) and TiO 2 (Alfa Aesar 99.9 %). Carefully weighed stoichiometric mixtures of initial ingredients were milled in disposable polyvinyl jars with Yt-stabilized ZrO 2 balls as milling media in ethanol for 24 h using bench-top planetary ball mill (QM-3SP2). The slurry was dried overnight, sieved and then calcined at 1,150 °C/4 h using alumina crucibles in air atmosphere in a KSLX 1800 chamber furnace at heating/ cooling rate of 5 °C/min. Calcined powders were re-milled for 24 h to further reduce the particle size and sieved after drying to dissociate agglomerates. Powder samples were pressed into 3–5 mm high and 10 mm diameter pellets at 100 MPa in a uniaxial manual pellet press. The pellets were sintered at 1,350 °C in the same furnace in air atmosphere.\nDensities of the sintered pellets were measured by Archimedean method using a MD-300s high precession densitometer. Detailed structural analyses were performed with synchrotron diffraction data collected at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF), China, at BL15U1 beam line with k = 0.69 A ˚ and a beam spot of area 7.5 9 2.0 lm 2 . A ﬁxed exit and liquid nitrogen cooled double crystal monochromator with two sets of Si crystals [Si (111) and Si (220)] was employed for data collection in nondepressive conﬁguration followed by a toroidal focusing mirror with a horizontal acceptance angle of 2.8 mrad.\nPowder samples were uniformly distributed on an adhesive tape and mounted on a sample holder accordingly. Diffraction patterns of the powder samples were recorded with Multi-Analyses on Radioactive Samples (MARS 345) imaging plate with the sample to detector distance of 207.729 mm. Diffraction patterns obtained in the form of ‘Debye’ rings were converted into one-dimensional X-ray proﬁle versus 2h using FIT2D software [14]. X-ray diffraction data was analyzed using standard computer program ‘RIETICA’. Raman spectroscopy of the samples was performed using a RENISHAW Raman spectrometer in the range of 100–800 cm -1 with Argon ion laser of wavelength 514.5 nm and operating power of 50 mW. A grating of 1,800 lines/mm was used for this purpose. Samples for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were polished, and thermally etched at temperatures 10 % less than the corresponding sintering temperatures for 30 min at a heating/cooling rate of 10 °C/min. Microstructural analysis of samples was performed using a FEI, QUANTA, FEG 650 SEM. Energy dispersive spectroscopy was performed using an INCA, SYNERGY (Oxford) EDS detector. Microwave dielectric properties of the samples were determined using S-parameter network analyzer (Hewlett Packard 8720ES, 50 MHz– 20 GHz) with Hakki and Coleman method [15, 16]. Measurement of Q 9 f was performed at TE 01d resonant mode in reﬂectance whereas e r was measured by TE 011 resonant mode. s f was determined by varying the temperature of the resonator between 20 and 80 °C using Eq. (1) s f ¼ ðf 2  f 1 Þ f 1 ðT 2  T 1 Þ ð1Þ where f 1 and f 2 are the resonant frequencies at temperature T 1 and T 2 respectively.",

In the magnetoconductivity measurements, the normal state resistivity  is canceled and its temperature dependence is no longer  needed. As the magneto-conductivity involves the nonzero  magnetic ﬁelds, it is considered as a more subtle probing  of the transport properties in the ﬂuctuation region than the  excess conductivity [18]. The magneto-conductivity data is  also analyzed taking into account the orbital contribution  according to AL and MT models for layered superconductors [14, 19]. Moreover, some important physical quantities  of intrinsic superconducting can be determined from the  magneto-conductivity ﬂuctuation analysis above T c .\nIn this work, the measured data of electrical resistivity versus temperature for the superconducting samples of  type   SmBa 2 Cu 3−x Ru x O 7−δ  with x = 0.00–0.30 was analyzed  through excess conductivity and magneto-conductivity  in absence and presence of applied dc magnetic ﬁeld of  0.44 T, respectively. Many superconducting parameters  were calculated from the analysis of both excess conductivity and magneto-conductivity as a function of Ru-content  for Sm-123 phase.\n2   Experimental  details Superconducting samples of type  SmBa 2 Cu 3−x Ru x O 7−δ ,  with x = 0.00, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20 and 0.30 were prepared using  conventional solid-state reaction technique.

The powder  was subjected to calcination process to remove any remaining volatile materials. This process was done twice in air  at 840 and 880 °C for 24h each with intermediate grinding and sieving. The obtained powder was again ground,  sifted and ﬁnally pressed into pellets using a hydraulic  press under 15 ton/cm 2  pressure to decrease the number of  voids and minimize the intergrain contact problems. Pellets (1.5cm diameter and 0.3cm thickness) were sintered  in a horizontal tube furnace at 930 °C with a heating rate of  4 °C/min and held at this temperature for 24h. The samples  were cooled by a rate of 1 °C/min down to 500 °C and kept  at this temperature for 10h under oxygen ﬂow to control  the oxygen content of the ﬁnal compounds. At the end, the  samples were slowly cooled by a rate of 1 °C/min down to  room temperature with continuity of oxygen flow.",

The constituent powders  were taken in a stoichiometric amount by using a digital balance (Mettler Toledo), and then mixed them homogeneously  under dry conditions for 4h. A small amount extra (i.e. 2%)  of   Bi 2 O 3  was added to the mixture to compensate the lost  quantity of bismuth during sample preparation at elevated  temperatures. Then, the mixture so obtained was calcined at  an optimized temperature (850°C) in a high-purity alumina  crucible with lid for 4h using a high temperature muﬄe  furnace. The formation of the compound and its structural  system with unit cell were checked using X-ray diﬀraction  (XRD) pattern and data recorded at room temperature by a  powder diﬀractometer (D8 Advance; Bruker) using CuKα  radiation (λ = 1.5405Å) in a wide range of Bragg’s angles  2θ (20° ≤ 2θ ≤ 60°). The crystal system, lattice parameters  of unit cell and Miller indices of the peaks were obtained by  using a standard computer program POWDMULT (version  2.2). Then, the calcined powder was used to make cylindrical pellets of diameter 12mm and thickness 0.5–2mm  under an isostatic pressure of about 4 × 10 6 Nm −2  by using  a KBR hydraulic press. Polyvinyl aldehyde (PVA) was used  as a binder. Then, the pellets were sintered in a covered  alumina crucible under aerobic conditions at 870°C. The  surface morphology of a sintered pellet was obtained from  a ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, M/s  ZEISS, model SUPRA 40). The elemental composition of  the sample was analyzed by EDAX (energy dispersive X-ray  analysis) spectrum. Then, a sintered pellet was polished on  both the sides to make them ﬂat, smooth and parallel, and  subsequently electroded with silver paste of high-purity. The  pellet was dried at 120°C for 4h to get the material free  from the moisture. The frequency  (10 3 –10 6 Hz) and temperature (25–500°C) dependence of electrical parameters  was obtained by using an impedance analyzer (N4L PSM,  1735) along with a laboratory made sample holder. The  current–voltage characteristic of the sample was obtained  at the temperature intervals of 25°C over the same temperature range using a programmable electrometer (model  6517B; Keithley). The room temperature hysteresis loops  were obtained using a P–E loop tracer (Radiant technologies, version 4.8.0). It should be noted that for memory and  spintronics devices, the high frequency (GHz) electrical data  are required [15–19].

High pressure reaction synthesis of TiB 2 /NiAl composites was reported by Bhaumik et al.\n[150]. Here nickel and aluminum powder were mixed with TiB 2 to composites with 10, 20 and 30 vol.% NiAl. The mixtures were heated to 900 °C under a pressure of 3 GPa, resulting in reaction products consisting of NiAl and Ni 3 Al.\nFurther annealing was required to obtain an NiAl matrix.\nResidual porosity of only *1% was possible for NiAl vol.% of 15 and higher. However, annealing of such products was found to increase the level of porosity, due to expansion of volatile impurities and adsorbed gaseous species [150]. Recently Dumez et al.

For a small scale (less than 40 g), the syn thesis and growth were done in the same fused silica tube to reduce unintended contamination that might occur in multistep process. The silica tube for Bridgman growth was of 11 mm inner diameter with a conical sh aped end. All processes for synthesis and crystal growth were done in vacuum, with an original pressure less than 10 −4 Torr (at room temperature). The sealed silica tube was placed on a support rod, which moved downwards with a geared translation system inside a two-zone vertical furnace for single crystal growth. The silica tube was heated up to 590 °C in 10 h and held at that temperature for 12 h for overheating to avoid heterogeneous nucleation. A temperature of 15–30 K of melt overheating helps to reduce excess nucleation centers and suppress the formation of structural defects. The temperature proﬁle was also optimized to avoid thermal-induced cracks and possible constitutional supercooling, thereby enhanci ng the single crystal yield of CsPbBr 3 . Once the silica tube completely passed with a dr opping speed of 0.5–2mmh −1 through the temperature gradient region (with a typical temperature gradient of 5–20 K cm −1 ), the ingot was cooled down to 200 °C in 20 h. Owing to the existence of phase transitions, the ingot was then cooled down to room temperature with a cooling rate of 2–5Kh −1 .Itshouldbenoted that excessive temperature gradient and dropping speed and cooling rate likely result in cracks and ﬁnal fracture of the ingots (Supplementary Figure 4).",

After the completion of the decomposition of acetate ions, the temperature of the solution was gradually increased to 523 K. During this heating process, the formation of the polymer between ethylene glycol and metal-citrate complexes was promoted.\nAs the solution was condensed, it became viscous, and this viscous product was decomposed to a ﬁne powder at 723 K. The obtained powder precursor was ground and calcined at 973 K for 12 h in air to remove a residual organic matter completely. The calcined powder was compressed by the hydrothermal hot-pressing technique similar to that reported in our previous studies [15, 16]. The calcined powder was kneaded with 0.05 M NaOH solution (10 mass% for the powder) to be set in the cylinder of an autoclave for the hydrothermal hot pressing (HHP).\nFigure 2 shows the schematic drawing of the autoclave used in this experiment. The autoclave has a cylinder made of stainless steel with an inside diameter of 20 mm and the sample is compressed by the piston in the cylinder from the top and bottom. The sample was ﬁrst compressed at the ambient temperature and the desired pressure (50– 200 MPa).

The starting aqueous solutions were dispensed into a 300 mL beaker to achieve a stoichiometric ratio of Zn 1.96 Mn 0.04 SiO 4 , followed by addition of urea or HMT, and the mixture was stirred. As needed, before adding the precipitant, HCl was added to the mixed solution to set the initial pH to 2.5. Distilled water was added to the mixed solution to adjust the total concentration of metal and silicon to 0.1 M (75 mL). The beaker was covered and heated in a water bath to bring the solution temperature to 363 K, and was held for 4 to 24 h and stirred at 400 rpm by a magnetic stirrer equipped with a heating plate to obtain a precipitate. The precipitate was separated by ﬁltration, washed with distilled water, and dried to obtain a precursor. This precursor was annealed at various temperatures for 2 h to obtain a ﬁnal sample. A similar approach was performed using bulk SiO 2 (particle size: 63–270 mm, Kanto Chemical, 99.9%), fumed silica (particle size: 7 nm, Aldrich), or TEOS as the silicon source, and these were compared to samples prepared from PGMS. The samples obtained using PGMS, SiO 2 , fumed silica, and TEOS as silicon sources are hereafter referred to as HP-PGMS, HP-SiO 2 , HP-fs, and HP-TEOS, respectively. The synthesis of the sample by a solid-state reaction (SSR) using ZnO (Kanto Chemical, 99.0%), Mn 3 O 4 (Kojundo Chemical, 99.9%), and SiO 2 powder as starting materials was also performed. Raw materials were weighed in a stoichiometric ratio, then they were thoroughly mixed using ethanol in an agate mortar. The mixture was calcined at 973–1573 K for 2 hours in air. All samples in the present research were heat-treated without addition of any ﬂuxes. The resulting samples were characterized by a powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD; Bruker, D2 PHASER), a scanning electron microscope (SEM; Hitachi, S-4800) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectra analyzer (EDS), and an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscope (ICP-AES; Perkin Elmer, Optima 3300XL). For ICP-AES analysis, samples were dissolved into 10% HF solution, then it was diluted to obtain the proper concentration. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of samples were obtained using a ﬂuorescence spectrometer (Hitachi, F4500). In the PL measurement, the pure sample without dilution was densely stuffed in a hole of a sample holder equipped with a quartz window. The sample holder ﬁlled with the sample was ﬁxed at the same position in a measurement room of the ﬂuorescence spectrometer using a jig for each measurement. Thus, the PL spectra were obtained under the same conditions. The PL spectra of commercial Zn 2 SiO 4 :Mn 2+ phosphors (Nemoto Lumi-Material, G-29 and GYL-D1) were also taken for comparison.

Our results conﬁrm that Sb acts as an effective n-type dopant and we estimate the maximum amount of Sb the Mg 2 Si 0.4 Sn 0.6 structure can accommodate to be 2.3% by XRD, DSC and EPMA analyses. The electron transport properties and low-temperature electronic heat capacity measurements reveal that both the light conduction band and the heavy conduction band contribute to the transport in n-type Mg 2 Si 0.4 Sn 0.6 solid solutions. The highest density-of-states effective mass and power factor were observed for Mg 2.16 (Si 0.4 Sn 0.6 ) 0.985 Sb 0.015 with an electron concentration of n z 1.67  10 20 cm 3 , which is likely to be due to the Fermi level positioned within  2k B T of both the heavy and light conduction bands providing contributions from both bands. In addition, doping with Sb does not seem to affect the lattice thermal conductivity above room temperature. TEM analysis indicates the presence of Sn-rich precipitates with the size of several tens of nanometers dispersed in the Mg 2 Si 0.4 Sn 0.6 matrix.\nSuch a nanophase may enhance the boundary scattering of phonons and contribute to a low lattice thermal conductivity. Owing to the above characteristics of the band structure and the microstructure, the Mg 2.16 (Si 0.4 Sn 0.6 ) 0.985 Sb 0.015 solid solution with n ¼ 1.67  10 20 cm 3 possessed excellent thermoelectric properties and achieved a high ZT value of 1.3 at 740 K. Further reductions in the lattice thermal conductivity could be achieved via optimization of the nanophase inclusions, leading to a further enhancement of the ﬁgure of merit for Mg 2 Si 0.4 Sn 0.6 -based solid solutions.\n1. Introduction On account of their abundant and low cost chemical constituents, which also happen to be environmentally friendly, Mg 2 Si 1x Sn x -based solid solutions have attracted considerable interest as prospective thermoelectric materials for waste heat recovery and conversion to electricity in the temperature range of 500–900 K.\n1–14 The conversion efﬁciency of thermoelectric materials is directly determined by the dimensionless ﬁgure of merit, ZT (where ZT ¼ a 2 sT/(k e + k ph )), where a, s, k e , k ph and T represent the Seebeck coefﬁcient, the electrical conductivity, the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity, the lattice thermal conductivity and the absolute temperature, respectively.\nThe goal of optimizing the thermoelectric properties is to enhance the power factor (PF ¼ a 2 s) and reduce the k ph at the same time in a strive to create a phonon–glass–electron–crystal 15 (PGEC).\nDuring the past decade, nano-structuring approac hes have been u sed to reduce the l attice thermal conductivity of thermoelectric materials in order to enhance their ZT values, especially as they pertain to the pre paration of bulk nan ocomposite materials.\n16–19 One particularly effective method is to take advantage of the features in the phase diagram of the structure. For instan ce, SrTe–PbTe 20 and PbTe–PbS 21,22 have been successfully prepared as nanocomposite bulk materials by controlling the nucleation–growth process of the second phase or by making use of the spinodal decomposition process. These in situ formed nano-structures form coherent interfaces with the matrix that have only a w eak inﬂuence o n charge carrier transport while effectively scattering mid-frequency phonons.\n23,24 While Mg 2 Si and M g 2 Sn are known to form solid a State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan 430070, China.

Indeed, in 2008, Zhang et al.\n4 reported an in situ formed nanostructure in the matrix of Sb-doped Mg 2 Si 0.4 Sn 0.6 . However, a detailed analysis of the nanostructure and its formation mechanism are still lacking and further investigations are need ed to clarify the issue.\nIn this research, w ith a focus on Si a nd Sn compositions within the presumed miscibility gap and with an awareness of the two-band structure of the conduction band, 1,2,14 we aim to explore the inﬂuence of S b d oping in Mg 2(1+z) (Si 0.4 Sn 0.6 ) 1y Sb y and clarify the role of the microstructure on the thermoelectric properties. In our p revious work, we indicated that the c onte nt of Mg has a signiﬁ cant impact on the electron concentration and thermoelectric properties of n-type Mg 2 Si 1x Sn x solid solutions.\n8 In particular, an appropriate excess of M g o ver its stoichiometric amount is beneﬁcial for the enhancem ent of ZT values in n-type Mg 2 Si 1x Sn x .

Experimental Mg 2.16 (Si 0.4 Sn 0.6 ) 1y Sb y (0 # y # 0.055) solid solutions were prepared by a two-step solid state reactio n method with subsequent spark plasma sintering (SPS). Commercial high-purity powders of Si (99.99%), Sn (99.9%) and Sb (99.99%) were weighed in stoichiometric amounts and powdered Mg was added with an excess of 8 mol% over its stoichiometric amount. The raw materials were hand-ground in an agate mortar in a glove box, cold pressed and sealed in quartz tubes under vacuum for the ﬁrst step of the solid state reaction at 873–973 K. The reaction products from the ﬁrst process were again ground into ﬁne powders in the glove box, cold pressed into a bulk, sealed in a quartz tube under vacuum and annealed at 973 K. This second step of the process is performed in order to promote the formation of solid solutions and increase the homogeneity of the elements. Finally, after the solid state reactio ns were complete, the products were gro und into ﬁne powders in the glove box and consolidated into dense bulk materials at 973 K under 35 MPa using SPS. After SPS, the dense bulk sam ples were cut into appropriate sizes for electrical and thermal transport studies using a diamond disk.",

This electrochemical behavior is shown to be correlated with reversible formation of the cubic Li 2 TiO 3 phase.\n1 Introduction The safety considerations surrounding lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have continued to increase as this technology is applied to new applications such as electric vehicles and renewable integration.\n1 Because of the stricter regulations surrounding these industries, the anode material Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 (LTO) remains as one of the best alternative compounds to traditional graphite.\n2 At room temperature this material exhibits a flat voltage plateau around 1.5 V vs. Li that prevents potential Li plating even at low temperature. Furthermore, due to its high rate capability the material is less susceptible to localized resistance eﬀects that can cause temperature peaks that decompose the organic electrolytes even though it has higher surface activity than graphite.\n3 The underlying causes for these properties have been studied by both experimental and computational techniques.\n2 From such studies it is known that the material undergoes a zero strain phase transition around 1.55 V vs. Li between the spinel [Li] 8a16c [Ti] 16d [Li 1/3 Ti 2/3 ] 16d [O 4 ] 32e and the rock salt 8a [Li 2 ] 16c [Ti] 16d [Li 1/3 Ti 2/3 ] 16d [O 4 ] 32e , as lithium is inserted into the material.\n4–9 During this process the inserted lithium occupies 16a site while also forcing the lithium from the spinel phase to move from 8a site into 16c sites. Further lithium insertion is possible via a single phase reaction down to 0 V vs. Li forming Li 8.5 Ti 5 O 12 .\n10,11 However, through low temperature experiments (80 K) and open circuit potential relaxation it has been shown that this material only exhibits a true two phase region at temperatures below 100 K.\n12 At room temperature the material can relax to a single phase solid solution, although detailed analysis employing STEM imaging and NMR analysis suggest that the material retains two phase nanodomains on the order of less than 9 nm.\n13,14 In this article we explore the phase reaction behavior of this material by employing a custom built high temperature galvanostatic cell. The high temperature cycling of this material helps to investigate a new area of the phase diagram of LTO, while also assessing the thermal stability of this material. This area remains of high importance since poor cell engineering has been reported to increase the internal resistance of the electrodes, which can contribute to a thermal runaway reaction in a cell. Furthermore, understanding of the high temperature phases and kinetics of LTO can help with the diagnosis and understanding of the failure mechanism these batteries can have when thermal runaway occurs. Our results indicate that at 400 1CdischargeofLi 4+x Ti 5 O 12 between 0 o x o 2 occurs via solid solution, before reaching a flat plateau between 2 o x o 3. Further discharge of LTO to 0.3 V vs. Li reveals minimal capacity addition after the 2nd cycle. In addition, from ex situ X-ray diffraction analysis, it appears that Li 2 TiO 3 is the second phase that forms during discharge, with LTO reappearing upon recharge.\n2 Methods Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 was synthesized via a solid state reaction by mixing and grinding together stoichiometric amounts of anatase TiO 2 with 5% excess LiCO 3 . The mixture was heated to 900 1C for 10 hours. The powder XRD pattern was obtained employing a Bruker D4 Endeavor diﬀractometer with Cu Ka1 radiation.\nPrior to high temperature testing the thermal stability of the material was examined by employing thermogravimetric (TG) and diﬀerential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements of the LTO sample by itself and in contact with a eutectic mixture a University of California, Berkeley, Department of Material Science and Engineering, Berkeley, CA, USA.

The TG-DSC measurements were performed in a STA 449 F1 from NETZSCH, Selb, Germany, under constant Ar flow of 10 ml s 1 at a heating rate of 5 K min 1 employing alumina crucibles. For each measurement 50 mg of LTO were used, and for the mixed sample 100 mg of LiCl–KCl were added. The high temperature electrochemical testing was performed employing a custom built galvanostatic cell shown in Fig. 1. The setup employs the coulometric titration method refined by Weppner and Huggins, 15 and Becker et al.\n16 The set-up for this work consists of an outer glass jar that supports a molybdenum crucible with a glass lid inside a vertical smelting furnace. The Mo crucible holds the molten electrolyte. The lid has four openings for placing a thermocouple and molybdenum current collectors for the working, reference and counter electrodes. The glass lid also has an extended bar to help raising or lowering the electrodes into the molten salt for changing the materials to be tested. The counter and reference electrodes for LTO measurements was an Al–Li alloy wire, and the working electrode was a smaller molybdenum crucible with micrometer holes that held the active material. For this experiment the reference and counter electrodes are fabricated by doing a coulometric titration at 400 1C of Al wires inside an Ar filled glovebox. The electrolyte used was a eutectic mixture of LiCl–KCl, with lithium held inside the smaller Mo crucible (working electrode). This eutectic mixture is employed since LiCl has a melting temperature of 7711 while the eutectic point is approximately 3501. This allows the use of Al wires and a wider window of operation without the risk of forming a solid phase. The Al wire had a 1.5 mm diameter and was lithiated at a current of 6 mA until the wire reached about 40% lithiation, placing it in a stable two phase region of the Al–Li phase diagram, with enough Li concentration such that Li can be removed and reinserted in subsequent experiments without moving out of the two phase region. Because molten lithium can diffuse outside the Mo crucible through the small openings, the electrolyte was replaced after the fabrication of the Al–Li wires to prevent unintended reduction of LTO.",

Electrochemical tests show that Ca doping significantly improves the reversible capacity and cyclability. The improvement is attributed to the formation of defects caused by the partial occupancy of Ca 2+ ions in lithi um lattice si tes, which reduce the resistance and thus improve the electrochemical properties.\nKeywords Lithium ion battey .\nLiNi 0.8 Co 0.2 O 2 .\nCa doping .\nDefects .\nDiffusion Introduction Lithium ion batteries are considered to be the best available power source for most portable electronic devices, owing to their higher energy density, larger power capacity, and higher working voltage, compared with other secondary batteries [1]. The cycle life and capacity of lithium ion batteries critically depend on the structural and electrochemical properties of the cathode materials. Traditionally, LiCoO 2 is used as commercial cathode material for lithium rechargeable batteries because of its high reversibility, reasonable rate capacity, and easy preparation. However, the toxicity of cobalt coupled with its high cost and low practical capacity limit further applications. Currently, LiNiO 2 is being developed to replace LiCoO 2 , due to the comparatively low cost, high energy density, and environmental advantages of the former. Nevertheless, this material is known to be difficult to synthesize and suffers from instabilities at high states of charge [2, 3]. Therefore, much research has been undertaken to search for new cathode materials to overcome these shortcomings [4–6].\nLiNi 1−x Co x O 2 (0<x<1) compounds, which are isostructural as LiCoO 2 and LiNiO 2 with hexagonal R-3m αNaFeO 2 -layered structures and have the advantages of both LiCoO 2 and LiNiO 2 , are considered as promising cathode materials for lithium secondary batteries [7–10]. Elements such as Fe, Al, Y, and Ga have been used for the partial substitution of Ni or Co to further enhance the electrochemical performance of the cathode materials [11–14].\nThe doped materials showed better structural stability and cycling behavior than the undoped ones. However, the electrochemically inactive dopant generally reduced the reversible cycling capacity.\nIn the present study, we report an improved reversible capacity and cycling performance of Ca-doped LiNi 0.8 Co 0.2 O 2 cathode material. The structural and electrochemical properties were investigated to find the reasons for the improvement in electrochemical properties.\nExperimental LiNi 0.8 Co 0.2 O 2 and Ca-doped LiNi 0.8 Co 0.2 O 2 cathode materials were synthesized by a rheological phase reaction method [15]. LiOH H 2 O, Ni(OH) 2 ,Co 2 O 3 , and Ca(OH) 2 were fully mixed by grinding in a molar ratio of 1:0.8:0.1:0.02. An appropriate amount of deionized water was added to get a rheological body, and the mixture was heated at 80 °C for 2 h in a closed container. After being dried at 120 °C, the mixture was sintered at 730 °C for 10 h in an oxygen atmosphere, and then cooled to room temperature to yield a black product.",

Density, molar volume and Vickers microhardness of the prepared glasses were measured. Infrared (IR) and UV–visible spectroscopic techniques were used for structural studies of these glasses. Density as well as the microhardness increase systematically and, conversely, the molar volume decreases with increasing the lead oxide content. This behavior can be explained by the correlation with the glass structure. Increasing the lead oxide content (C20 mol%) increases the network former PbO 4 groups which can play an important role in increasing the connectivity and compactness of the glass matrix via increasing the cross-linking with the other constituent silicate and bismuthate structural units. The increased compactness may explain, in turn, the increase of the density and microhardness. IR spectra reinforce the idea that bismuth participates in the glassy network predominantly as BiO 6 octahedral structural units.\nUV–VIS optical absorption spectra revealed UV-charge transfer absorption bands related to the contribution of Pb 2? ions in the region 350–385 nm; in addition to the extrinsic absorption of trace iron impurities in the range 220–290 nm. In the visible region, three optical bands in the ranges 415–435, 605–650 and 880–890 nm were correlated with the contribution of electronic transitions in Bi 3? ions. Calculation of the optical mobility gap and the width of the energy tail of glass from the UV–VIS absorption indicated a slight increase followed by a decrease in their values. The behavior change occurred at the glass in which PbO content is 20 mol% where lead oxide starts to participate into the glassy matrix as a network former. The combination of analytical FTIR and UV– visible spectroscopy provided a consistent picture of structure–property relations in this glass system.\n1 Introduction Heavy metal glasses based on Bi 2 O 3 and PbO have received much interest because of their thermal stability [1] and interesting properties. These glasses exhibit high thirdorder nonlinear optical susceptibility which makes them useful for ultra-fast optical switches, optic and optoelectronic devices [2, 3]. They are promising materials for technological applications such as upconverting phosphors, new laser materials, and optical waveguides due to their low phonon energy [3, 4]. They have special applications in the area of thermal and mechanical sensors, reﬂecting windows, low-loss ﬁber optic and infrared (IR)-transmitting materials (because of their long infrared cut-off wavelengths in excess of 9 lm) [5, 6]. They are also used to produce, after appropriate annealing, high temperature superconductors with controllable microstructure [7, 8].\nBismuthate glasses are attractive to researchers because of their unique structural characteristics, which result from coordination changes in bismuth. Despite the fact that Bi 2 O 3 is not a conventional glass former, due to its high polarizability and small ﬁeld strength of Bi 3? ions, in the presence of conventional glass formers (such as SiO 2 , B 2 O 3 ,P 2 O 5 , GeO 2 , etc.), it may build a glass network of [BiO n ](n = 3, 6) pyramids [1, 9–12].

It is well known that glasses containing PbO exhibit high refractive indices and low crystallization tendency [13]. They are also low melting glasses with low glass transition temperatures. It has been found that lead and bismuth oxides do not form glasses by themselves and glasses in the system Bi 2 O 3 –PbO can be obtained only with the roller technique at cooling rates in the range 10 3 –10 4 K/s [2]. We have observed that the appropriate addition of SiO 2 in the system Bi 2 O 3 –PbO improves dramatically the glass forming ability in this ternary system. To our knowledge, these glasses have not been extensively studied and reported.\nThe objective of the present work is the characterization of SiO 2 –PbO–Bi 2 O 3 glasses using density and Vickers microhardness measurements, FTIR and UV–visible spectroscopy.\n2 Experimental 2.1 Glass preparation SiO 2 –PbO–Bi 2 O 3 glasses having the composition of 35SiO 2 –xPbO–(65 - x)Bi 2 O 3 (where x = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 35, 45; in mol%) were prepared using the conventional melting and annealing method. The starting materials used in the present study were powders of analytical reagent grade of SiO 2 ,Pb 3 O 4 and Bi 2 O 3 , respectively. Well mixed powders containing appropriate amounts of the raw materials were melted in a platinum crucible in an electric furnace at 900–950° C for 30 min. in air. The glass formed by quenching the melt on a preheated stainless-steel mold was immediately transferred to another mufﬂe furnace where it was annealed at about 300 °C for 1 h. Then, the mufﬂe was switched off and the temperature decreased to room temperature with a rate 25 °C/h.",

The DTA/TGA curves were run simultaneously on each sample from room temperature to 1000 °C, in flowing nitrogen at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The electrica l properties were studied by ac impedance spectroscopy and dc methods. The experiments were conducted in the temperature range of 12 to 350 °C in argon atmosphere. The pellets for electrical measurements were uniaxially pressed at ∼5×10 8 Pa, resulting in cylindrical pellets of 7 mm in diameter and thickness of 1 to 3 mm, corresponding to an average density ∼2.8 gcm −3 .

Cylindrical pellets having dimension 13 mm diameter and 2 mm thickness were prepared by hydraulic press with a pressure of 10 ton/cm 2 .\nSintering schedule of the pressed pellets were carried out at slow step heating rate 100 °C/h with a constant soaking periods of 2 h at 200 and 600 °C using high temperature programmable (Eurotherm controller, Model: 2204) vacuum furnace. This soaking period is required to remove any volatile impurities/organic materials (binder) from pellets.\nFinally samples are sintered at three different temperatures (750, 800, and 850 °C) for 8 h. All thick sintered samples were polished with the same pellets/powders to avoid surface contamination for obtaining thickness down to submillimeter (0.15 mm) for the measurement of leakage current density.",

Firstly, an appropriate amount of Cu(NO 3 ) 2 3H 2 O was dissolved in ethanol to form solution 1, and calculated amount of Ca(COOH) 2 4H 2 O was dissolved in distilled water to form solution 2. Meanwhile, Ti(OC 4 H 9 ) 4 was dissolved into ethanol, and CH 3 COOH was added into the solution immediately under vigorously stirring to form solution 3.\nSecondly, solution 1 was added into solution 3 slowly under stirring followed by stirring for 20 min, then solution 2 was added into the preceding mixed solution under stirring, and the mixed solutions were then stirred for 1 h at room temperature after the pH value was adjusted to 3.\nThen, the mixture was dried at 85 °C for 15 h and 125 °C for 8 h in a drying oven, followed by drying at 350 °C for 3 h in a mufﬂe furnace to form the precursor. Finally, different CCTO powders were obtained by calcining the precursor at 700, 750, 800, 850, 900 and 1000 °C for 10 h, respectively. The as-prepared different CCTO powders were pressed into different pellets with the diameter of 10 mm under the pressure of 200 MPa. Different CCTO ceramics were obtained by sintering the different pellets at 1050 °C for 20 h.",

The mixed powder was ball-milled overnight with zirconia media in isopropyl alcohol (IPA). After drying on a hot plate, the mixture was heated at 850  C for 10 h in ambient air and ball-milled again overnight. The dried powder was heated at 900  C for 10 h and ball-milled for 24 h, then the powder was pressed uniaxially into disks (z1-in. dia). Dense ceramic disks were prepared by sintering in air, in N 2 , and in 100 ppm H 2 /N 2 at 1330e1350  C for 6e10 h. To observe the effect of Zr 4þ doping on the oxygen permeation ﬂux, another composition, BaFe 0.975 Zr 0.025 O 3d (BFZ0), was made by sintering at 1250  C for 6 h in 100 ppm H 2 /N 2 . The crystal structure, microstructure, and purity were determined for the BFZ samples sintered in different environments. For the coal-gas-assisted watersplitting experiment, a BFZ tube with one end closed was prepared in the N 2 atmosphere (O.D. of 0.96 cm, I.D. of 0.75 cm, and length of 5.74 cm). The thickness of the tube was determined to be 1.05 mm, and the tube’s outside and inside surface area was 17.3 cm 2 and 13.5 cm 2 , respectively. To activate the surface of a 0.67-mm-thick BFZ disk during EtOH reforming, Rh catalyst was deposited on one of its faces. Rhodium nitrate, Rh(NO 3 ) 3 ,2H 2 O (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%), was dissolved in deionized water, and then XUS binder (poly-vinyl butyral) and BFZ powder were added to the solution. Heating the solution with binder and powder at <80  C while stirring gave a viscous paste, which was painted onto the surface of the BFZ disk. The painted disk was dried in air and installed for an ethanol reforming test at 600  C.",
