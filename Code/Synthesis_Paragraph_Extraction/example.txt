Keywords: Group 12 compounds; Pi interactions; Ionic radius 1. Introduction The synthesis and characterization of novel frameworks and materials have currently attracted considerable interest in coordination chemistry and materials science, becau se of their intriguing structural diversities and potential applications in many ﬁelds, such as, catalysis, functional materials and lightemitting materials. As we know, rigidity, electron-donor properties and spacial hindrance of ligand, and radius and qualities of metal ions, have been shown to play signiﬁcant roles in determining structure and qualities of materials.
However, there is no generally successful approach to predict and control the coordination number of metal centers and the structure of metal coordination complexes. Therefore, the investigation and understanding of the relationships between structure of complexes and metal radius, as well as the nature of ligand are important, and seem to be a long-range challenge [1]. Herein, we select the ligand N-(3-pyridylmethyl)benzimidazole (L) to investigate the effect of radius of metal ions (Zn 2C ,Cd 2C and Hg 2C ) on structure. L can be considered as a hybrid of 4,4 0 -bipyridine and 2,2 0 -biimidazole, which are versatile N-donor ligands in transition metal chemistry. From a structural point of view, it should be pointed out that (1) this ligand, unlike the rigidity of bipyridine, posse sses ﬂexibility owing to the presence of a –CH2– spacer between the pyridyl ring and benzimidazole moiety; (2) if both N-donor sites can coordinate to the metal center, the L can acts as m 2 -bridging ligand. Accordingly, a grid or chain-like structure may be expected by introducing metal ions favoring tetra- or hexacoordination mode; (3) due to its unsymmetrical nature, L can be considered as a pote ntial ligand for the construction of acentric solids based on two-dimensional (2D) grids [2].
Among our attempts, three d 10 compounds [ZnL 2 Cl 2 ](1), [Cd 3 L 4 Cl 6 ] n (2) and [HgL 2 Cl 2 ] n (3), were obtained as crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray analysis [3].

correction was applied. The structures of 1 and 3 were determined by directed methods while that of 2 was determined by methods of heavy atoms, and they were reﬁned on F 2 by the full-matrix least-squares technique through using of the SHELXTLK97 program package [13]. All non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotrophically, and h ydrogen atoms were introduced geometrically. Crystallographic data of 1–3 are outlined in Table 2.

3. Results and discussion Colorless crystals of 1 were obtained from the reaction of ZnCl 2 and L, and its structure was determined by a single crystal X-ray diffraction study. A drawing of 1 is shown in Fig. 1 with selected bond distances and angl es listed in Table 1.
The crystal struct ure reveals that the Zn 2C center in 1 is coordinated with two N atoms from two different Ls and two Cl K . The coordination geometry of the Zn 2C is tetrahedral Fig. 2. Drawing of the Cd 2C coordination mode.

with L and Cl K , being terminal ligands. The Zn–N and Zn–Cl bond distances are 2.02 2(3), 2.024(3), 2.2485(10), and 2.2468(10) A ˚ , respectively. Three bond angles of N(5)–Zn(1)–Cl(2), N(5)–Zn(1)–N(6) and Cl(1)–Zn(1)–Cl(2) are 108.25(8)8,108.09(11)8 and 116.41(4)8, which indicate that 1 has near ly an ideal tetrahedral geometry.
Single-crystal X-ray analysis reveals that the crystal structure of complex 2 is an one-dimensional boxy framework containing the basic [Cd 3 (m 2 -Cl) 4 ] planes. As shown in Fig. 2 with selected bond distances and angles listed in Table 1, the [Cd 3 (m 2 -Cl) 4 ] plane contains two types of Cd 2C . Cd1, which located at the center of symmetry, is coordinated in an octahedral environment by four bridged m 2 -Cl K and two nitrogen atoms from pyridine ring of two Ls. The bond angles of N(4)–Cd(2)–Cl(5), N(4)–Cd(2)–N(1) and N(1)–Cd(2)–Cl(5) are 129.38(7), 84.94(8) and 91.81(6)8, which indicate that Cd(2), coordinated with three Cl K (two m 2 -Cl K and one terminal Cl K ) and two nitrogen atoms from benzimidazole ring of two Ls (one L acts as brid ging ligand and the other acts as terminal ligand), has a slightly distor ted trigonal bipyramidal geometry. The Cd–Cl bond distances range from 2.4574(9) to 2.7063(10) A ˚ .
The Cd/Cd separation within a sheet is 3.891 A ˚ , which is consistent with the values reported in the related comple xes [4]. To our knowledge, some compounds that containing the [Cd 3 (m 2 -Cl) 4 ] plane have been reported [5]. The Cd–N bond distances of 2.2468(10)–2.2468(10) A ˚ fall into the normal range [6]. Each two neighboring [Cd 3 (m 2 -Cl) 4 ] planes are linked by two bridging Ls, and this resulting coordination generates interlocking structure of trimetallic sheets to form one-dimensional chain along the a-axis, with the separation between the two neig hboring trimetallic sheets being 10.503 A ˚ .
Between sheets, many approximate cubical boxes, like rows of reactors, are constructed through aromatic rings (Fig. 3).
Between adjacent imidazole rings from different chains, there have strong p–p interactions in an off-set fashion with the face-to-face distance being 3.4518 A ˚ . Through the strong p–p interactions, a two-dimensional framework is stacked along the c-axis, as illustrated in Fig. 4.
The structure of complex 3 features a one-dimensional and wave-like polymer. As shown in Fig. 5 with selected bond distances and angles listed in Table 1, Each Hg 2C completes its tetrahedral geometry with two terminal Cl K and two nitrogen atoms. The two nitrogen atoms from different L are different.
One com es from imidazole ring of L, and the other comes from pyridine ring of L. Each L acts as m 2 -bridge ligand through its two N atoms to link Hg 2C into a one-dimensional wavelike chain along the b-axis (as shown in Fig. 6). The Hg–N Fig. 4. Pi–Pi stacking diagram of compound 2.

distances are 2.246(4) and 2.391(5) A ˚ , and the Hg–Cl distances are 2.385(2) and 2.419( 2) A ˚ . Three bond angles of Cl(1)–Hg1– N(1), Cl(1)–Hg(1)–N(3) and Cl(1)–Hg(1)–Cl(4) are 125.67(14), 99.74(15) and 121.26(8)8, which indicate that 3 has a distorted tetrahedral geometry. In complex 3, p–p interactions between chains are very special. As shown in Fig. 7, each L coordinated to Hg 2C has two types of p–p interactions, one being generated among benzimidazole rings and another between two pyridine rings. In an off-set fashion, a benzimidazole ring produces p–p interactions with two close benzimidazole rings, the face-to-face distance being 3.5809 A ˚ , and 3.4984 A ˚ at the opposite direction. Pyridine ring produces p–p interactions with an adjacent pyridine ring in an off-set fashion and the face-to-face distance is 3.4205 A ˚ . As shown in Fig. 7. Pi–Pi stacking mode of the Hg 2C complex.

Figs. 7 and 8, at ﬁrst one chain is connected with two other chains through p–p interactions of pyridine rings to form a 2D structure at the (0 1 1) plane. Then alon g the a-axis the interaction fashion results in an inﬁnite 3D stacking structure among linear complexes.
4. Conclusion As the ionic radius increases from Zn 2C (0.88 A ˚ )to Cd 2C (1.09 A ˚ ) and then to Hg 2C (1.16 A ˚ ) [7], the structure also changes. Obviously, the ionic radius has an important effect on the structura l change. The Zn 2C radius being small, it has large spacial hindrance of ligand while forming a linear structure, so compound 1 is monomeric. Comparing to complex 2, the radius of Hg 2C is too big, not being suitable to generate the same structure. In complex 2, the coordination number of Cd 2C is more than that of Zn 2C and Hg 2C , and this may result in that the charge of Cd 2C is dispersed more. So, the Cd–X (X Z Cl or N) distances are longer. In compound 1, the dihedral angle of pyridine ring and benzimidazo le ring of L is 112.885(4)8 and the bond angle of C(11)–C(10)–N(2) is 88.6508, while being 115.127(4)8 and 81.1948 (C(7B)–C(4)–N(2)) in compound 3. In complex 2, there has two types of L, one being bridging and another being terminal. In terminal L, the dihedral angle of pyridine and benzimidazole ring is 113.741(17)8 and the bond angle of C(9)–C(8)–N(2) is 75.5658, while being 110.385(17)8 and 87.6208 (C(22)– C(21)–N(5)) in bridging L. From these data, we may see that the L has some spacial hindrance due to big aromatic rings, but has ﬂexibility through methylene, which makes benzimidazole and pyri dine ring rotate freely. Through adapting angles, L coordinates to metal center easily and forms different frameworks. These facts indicate that the ionic radius and ligand are all the factors of constructing a structure.
5. IR, thermogravimetric analysis and ﬂuorescent spectra All of the three compounds show strong characteristic bands of aromatic groups of pyridine ring and benzimidazole ring at 3400–3500, 3000–2900 and 1650– 1450 cm K1 (Fig. 9).To assess the thermal stability of the three compounds, TGA was performed on them in the temperature range of 26–750 8C under N 2 . Their thermal decomposition behaviors were very similar. The TG/DTA curves show neither weight loss nor structural change up to about 260 8C for 1 (266 8C for 2, and 279 8C for 3), demonstrating that these frameworks were retained up to these high temperatures, which indicates the p–p interactions play an important role for stability of compounds, especially that in 3. Immediately above this point, the samples began to lose Ls, and the whole frameworks collapsed in continuous fashions.
The excitation and emiss ion spectra of compound 1 , 2 and 3 were measured in the solid state at room temperature.
As shown in Fig. 10, the results show that 1 exhibits an intense photoluminescence emission at 544 nm (l ex Z 370 nm), while 2 and 3 also exhibit intense photoluminescence emission at 500 nm (l ex Z442 nm), and 536 nm (l ex Z 370 nm), respectively. Pyridine absorbs at ca.

an absorbance at ca. 290 nm and emits at ca. 350 nm.
Seeing from Fig. 11, protonated benzimidazole and pyridine are linked to N-(3-pyridylmethyl)benzimidaz ole by a methylene, and protonated benzimidazole and pyridine are not conjugated. So it is quite obvious that coordination of protonated benzimidazole and pyridine quenches normally the ﬂuorescence emission and leads that the spectra is very red shifted. Because in d 10 -metal ions with one or two positive charges, the d-orbitals are contracted and therefore the electrons in these orbitals are much less accessible for back bonding to p-acc eptor ligands, and group 12 dications have the weak electro-accepting nature with respect to electrons from L. So these emissions may be assigned to the ligand-to-metal charge-transfer band [8]. The difference between the three emission bands may be due to the different coordination environments of the metal cations in these comp ounds, which suggest that the change of coordination modes, to some extent, exerts a signiﬁca nt effect on their ﬂuorescent properties [9]. The fact speciﬁes that qualities are determined mostly by ligands and structural types, and through adjusting of them, we can obtain materials of different physical properties.
