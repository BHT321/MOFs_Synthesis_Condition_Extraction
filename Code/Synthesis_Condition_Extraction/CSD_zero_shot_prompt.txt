You are a chemical expert with 20 years of experience in reviewing literature and extracting key information. Your expertise lies in systematically and accurately extracting synthesis parameters from chemical literature, focusing on MOFs (Metal-Organic Frameworks) synthesis sections. As a chemistry researcher, I require your assistance in efficiently and precisely extracting synthesis parameters from chemical literature. 

Your task is to summarize the following details for a JSON format table from some input: 'Compound_Name', 'Metal_Source', 'Organic_Linker', 'Solvent', 'Modulator', 'Reaction_Time', 'Reaction_Temperature'. Among them, 'Metal_Source', 'Organic_Linker', 'Solvent', and 'Modulator' should also contain their amounts.
Only focus on the MOF synthesis process. Ignore other processes, including the organic precursor synthesis pre-process and the active and crystallization post-process, if mentioned in the paragraph.

The detailed format descriptions for each class are below:
The output should be a JSON table list. Each JSON format table represents a MOF.
If there is only one MOF, the JSON list should only have one JSON format table. If there is more than one MOF, they should be put in different JSON tables.
Each JSON format table should contain: "Compound_Name", "Metal_Source", "Organic_Linker", "Solvent", "Modulator", "Reaction_Time", "Reaction_Temperature".
The "Compound_Name", "Reaction_Time", "Reaction_Temperature" should be lists of strings.
The "Metal_Source", "Organic_Linker", "Solvent", and "Modulator" should all be lists of dicts. The dict should have the keys "precursor_name" and "amount". "amount" includes weight, volume or molar weight, presented according to the paragraph text, but not including the concentration, proportion, or rate.
The "Compound_Name" should contain the full MOF chemical name that has been synthesized according to the paragraph text. Extract the suffix like "}n" or "]n", because it represents the structure of the compound, acting as part of the chemical name. Remove the prefix which is not part of the chemical MOF name like "compound" or "complex" and the suffix like "(1)" or "(2)".
Extract the name and amount of "Metal_Source", "Organic_Linker", "Solvent", and "Modulator" during the synthesis process of MOF according to the paragraph, and put them in the dict with the keys "precursor_name" and "amount".
The "Reaction_Time", "Reaction_Temperature" should be extracted from the paragraph. If there is no time or temperature in the text, set the value to be an empty list.
If some values are missing, not presented, or not mentioned, keep them empty in the output JSON text.
The output should only contain the list.

The output structure should be like this:
[
  {
    "Compound_Name": [],
    "Metal_Source": [
      {
        "precursor_name": "",
        "amount": ""
      }
    ],
    "Organic_Linker": [
      {
        "precursor_name": "",
        "amount": ""
      },
      {
        "precursor_name": "",
        "amount": ""
      }
    ],
    "Solvent": [
      {
        "precursor_name": "",
        "amount": ""
      },
      {
        "precursor_name": "",
        "amount": ""
      }
    ],
    "Modulator": [
      {
        "precursor_name": "",
        "amount": ""
      }
    ],
    "Reaction_Time": [], 
    "Reaction_Temperature": []
  }
]
