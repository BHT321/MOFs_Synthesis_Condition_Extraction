Over the course of 24–48 h, plentiful colorless bar shaped crystals and a varie ty of very thin, small colorless crystals grew throughout the ampoule. The analysis of the crystalline products in multiple ampoules demonstrated that while compound 2 was the major product, small amounts of other crystalline products formed. Due to the fragility and poor crystal quality of these other products, it was not possible to fully characterize these products. Several samples were sent for elemental analysis, but the results were inconclusive due to the difficulties of getting enough pure product for analysis. The IR (cm 1 ) results: 1590 (s), 1406 (s), 1323 (s), 1216 (m), 805 (s), clearly indicate the presence of nitrate groups coordinated to the metal."

A light orange precipitation formed immediately. After a few hours, the solution was Ðltered. The clear Ðltrate was kept under diethyl ether vapor for a week. Light-orange crystals were obtained. The yield of compound 2 varied from 20%È60%, depending on the concentration of the solution and the rate of crystallization. No satisfactory CHN analysis results could be obtained despite repeated attempts. The poor agreement between the observed and calculated CHN values is likely caused by the presence of water molecules in the crystal lattice of 2."

Small white crystals (75% yield), diamond type, suitable for X-ray diffraction studies, appeared on standing the final solution at room temperature (3–4 days). TG: The decomposition of the complex takes place in two steps.\nThe water was loosed smoothly between 10 0 and 180 C [calc.: 3.3; found: 3.0%]. The first overall step takes place in the 100–250 C temperature range implying a higher decomposition of the molecule at 200 C, whereas the second overall step occurs in the 350–500 C temperature range with a higher loss about 450 C. The weight loss associated with these two steps is in accordance with the expected value for the total decomposition of the complex [calc.: 59.96; found: 60.54% (1st step 24.66; 2nd step 35.94)], leading to the final residue Ag [calc.: 40.04; found: 39.39%].

The gallium-based MIL-68 compound was synthesized from a mixture of gallium nitrate (0.8 mmol, 207.4 mg), terephthalic acid (0.6 mmol, 100 mg), and DMF (70 mmol, 5 mL). The reactants were placed in a Teflon-lined Parr autoclave and heated for 10 h at 100 °C in an oven. This resulted in the formation of a white powdered phase, which was filtered off and washed with DMF. The yield was 52% based on gallium. This corresponds to the following chemical formula for MIL-68 (Ga): Ga(OH)(O 2 C-C 6 H 4 -CO 2 ) · 0.9DMF · zH 2 O. Scanning electron microscopy shows that the MIL-68 (Ga) phase is composed of small needlelike crystallites of ≈2 µm length (Figure 1). In water, the gallium analog of MIL-53 34 was formed, and details of the structural features will be discussed elsewhere."

        "paragraph": "2.2. Synthesis and X-ray crystal structure determinations of Zn-PLA   The reaction of H 4 PLA with Zn(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O in N,N-dimethylformamide-H 2 O (4:1, v/v) solvent  mixture in the presence of 45% aqueous HBF 4  at 90 °C in a tightly-capped glass vial led to flaky  crystals  after  48  h.  X-ray  single  crystal  structure  determination  (deposition  number:  CCDC  1429649) revealed that the crystals belong to monoclinic system with I2 space group,  cf. ESI.  The asymmetric unit cell was found to contain 1.5 molecules of PLA, two Zn 2+  metal ions, two  coordinated  water molecules  and one dimethylammonium  (DMA)  cation. Thus,  the molecular  formula  of  the  asymmetric  repeating  unit  is  [Zn 2 (L) 1.5 (H 2 O) 2 •Me 2 NH 2 ].  The  1.5  molecules  of  PLA account for six units of negative charge, which is compensated by two Zn 2+  ions and two  DMA cations; unfortunately, one of the DMA cations could not be located due to disorder in the  large  void  volume.  A  careful  analysis  showed  that  one  of  these  DMA  cations  is,  indeed,  stabilized inside the voids by strong hydrogen bonds with the oxygen atoms of the carboxylate  groups  of  PLA,  cf.,  ESI.  The  crystal  structure  analysis  reveals  that  there  exist  two  crystallographically independent Zn 2+  ions, i.e.,  Zn1 and Zn2, both of which are tetrahedral in  geometry, cf. Fig. 2. Interestingly, Zn1 is found to be coordinated by four oxygen atoms of four  ligand  carboxylate  groups,  while  Zn2  is  coordinated  by  four  oxygen  atoms  of  two  ligand  carboxylates and  two  water molecules. Thus,  Zn1 behaves  as a 4-connecting node,  while  Zn2  serves as a 2-connecting node. In Fig. 2 are shown coordination modes of the carboxylate groups  of  PLA.  The  assembly  of  Zn 2+   ions  and  the  organic  spacer  PLA  leads  to  formation  of  a  3D  anionic  porous  framework  structure  with  channels  that  propagate  down  a-axis,  Fig.  2.  The  solvent  accessible  volume,  which  includes  the  missing  DMA  cation,  in  Zn-PLA  MOF  was  calculated to be 35.5% by Mercury (gridstep = 0.7 Å and probe radius = 1.2 Å). Interestingly, the  3D-framework  of  Zn-PLA  corresponds  to  a  new  topology  with  a  point  symbol  of"

The reaction mixture was stirred for 10 min to give a white suspension. The precipitate was filtered off and washed with CH 3 CN to give a pure powder(1) in 85% yield. Melting point: 155 °C. A sample of complex 1 was solved in CH 3 CN and the solution is kept several days to obtain high-quality colorless single crystals. Both two complexes single crystals were suitable for X-ray measurements."
