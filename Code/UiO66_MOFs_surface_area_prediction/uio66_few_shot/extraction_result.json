The solution was transferred to a 500 mL Teﬂonlined autoclave and maintained at 393 K under static conditions for 24 h. The precipitates were isolated and then subject to three-time solvent exchange using fresh 30 mL DMF, in which the precipitates were soaked in DMF for 12 h each time. Afterwards, the precipitates were soaked in free ethanol (30 mL) for three-time solvent exchange similarly. Finally, the solids were ﬁrstly dried in oven at 80 °C for 12 h, and then dried under vacuum at 453 K for 12 h.UiO-67 was synthesized using a previously reported method in literature (Oien-Odegaard et al., 2016) with a slight modiﬁcation.",

Crystal structure of UiO-66 and its defected form (a), PXRD patterns of the synthesized UiO-66 and the simulated UiO-66 (b) and SEM images of UiO-66 synthesized  in this study (c).  thalic  acid  (C  6  H  4  (CO  2  H)  2  ,  99%),  formic  acid  (CH  2  O  2  ,  99%)  and  acetic acid (C  2  H  4  O  2  , 99%) were obtained from Acros Organics. The  n-alkanes  (pentane,  hexane,  heptane,  and  octane),  and  the  polar  solvents  (N,  N-dimethylformamide,  DMF,  dichloromethane,  DCM,  chloroform, benzene, toluene, ether, acetonitrile and tetrahydrofu-  ran,  THF) at  highly  pure grade  (99%) were  purchased from  Fisher  Scientiﬁc.  2.2.  General synthesis procedure of the UiO-66-based MOFs  With  some  modiﬁcations,  UiO-66  was  synthesized  under  con-  ditions  similar  to  those  reported  in  the  literature  [ 39 , 40 ].  In  this  study, the metal source used was ZrCl  4  and the organic linker was  terephthalic  acid.  Brieﬂy,  in  a  500  ml  autoclavable  reagent  bot-  tle,  795 mg  of  ZrCl  4  (3.4  mmol) and  566 mg  of  terephthalic  acid  (3.4  mmol)  were  dissolved  with  250  ml  of  DMF  by  sonication  at  room temperature after the addition of 15 ml of acetic acid to the  mixture.  The  obtained  mixture  was  placed  in  a  preheated  oven  at  120  °C  for  21  h.  After  21  h,  the  bottle  was  removed  from  the  oven  and  was  left  to  cool  to  room  temperature.  The  content  of  the  bottle  was  then  transferred  to  a  falcon  tube  and  the  white  precipitate obtained was collected by centrifugation. The obtained  MOF was washed with two solvents: ﬁrst, four times with approx-  imately 60 ml DMF, and then four times with approximately 60 ml  DCM.  For  each  solvent,  during  the  ﬁrst  three  washes,  the  MOF  were allowed to settle in each wash for 3 h, but in the last wash,  the  MOFs were  soaked  in the  fresh  solvent  overnight.  Then, UiO-  66  was  dried  in  a  vacuum  oven  at  150  °C  overnight  for  thermal  activation.  2.3.  Structural characterization of UiO-66-based MOFs  The  synthesized  UiO-66  was  fully  characterized  using  powder  X- ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), N  2  sorption measurements and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). For  the  PXRD  analysis,  the  patterns  were  recorded  with  an  advanced  Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer (Bruker AXS GmbH, Karlsruhe, Ger-  many,  operating  at 40  kV  and  current 40  mA,  range  2 θ:  5  –50 °,  increment:  0.01 °)  using  Cu  K α radiation  ( λ =  1.5418  ˙ A).",

The two solutions were mixed together under stirring and sonication to obtain well-dispersed mixture. The reaction took place at 120 °C for 24 h. The ﬁnal UiO-66/GO product was obtained by following similar washing and drying steps to those used for UiO-66.2.1.4. Synthesis of UiO-66-NH 2 and UiO-66-NH 2 /GO UiO-66-NH 2 was synthesized analogously to UiO-66 by increasing the amount of ZrCl 4 to 3.68 mmol and replacing H 2 BDC ligand of UiOJ. Pokhrel et al.",

Chemicals and preparation of MOFs  All  reagent  grade  chemicals  for  synthesis  of  MOFs were  commercially  available  products  and  used  without  further  purication.  Zinc  nitrate hexahydrate (Zn[NO 3 ] 2 ⋅6H 2 O, 98%), zirconyl chloride octahydrate (ZrOCl 2 ⋅8H 2 O, ≥ 98%), trimethylamine (TEA, 99%), and 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (terephthalic acid, BDC, 98%) were purchased from  Sigma  Aldrich,  USA.  Dimethylformamide  (DMF,  99.0%)  and  ethanol  (99.5%) were obtained from Samchun Chemicals, Seoul, South Korea.  Hydrochloric  acid  (HCl,  35.0–37.0%)  was  purchased  from  Junsei  Chemical Co. Ltd., Seoul, South Korea. Chloroform was purchased from  Daejung Chemicals & Metals, South Korea.  The  UiO-66  and  MOF-5  sorbents  for  TD-based  quantitation  of  FA  were prepared in the laboratory following literature procedures [17,40].  In the case of MOF-5, metal and linker solutions were prepared by dissolving Zn(NO 3 ) 2 ⋅6H 2 O (1.4 g, 4.71 mmol) and BDC (0.3 g, 1.81 mmol)  in separate 25 mL DMF solutions. As the reagent was added, the DMF  was stirred constantly at 1,000 rpm using a magnetic bar on a digital  hotplate stirrer (Daihan Scientic, South Korea).  After both solutions  achieved  complete  dissolution  under  stirring,  they  were  mixed  with  prolonged stirring (10 min). Then, 2 mL of TEA was added drop-wise to  the mixed solution as a catalyst to reduce the reaction time of MOF-5  synthesis to<120 min. The nal solution was covered with aluminum  foil for 2 h at room temperature. The precipitate was retrieved using a  glass microber lter (47 mm diameter, Whatman, UK) with a mini-  diaphragm vacuum  pump  (N86KT.18,  KNF,  UK)  at  a  pressure  difference of 0.01 bar and ltering time of 5 min. The ltrated MOF-5 was  washed twice with DMF to remove excess BDC and impurities. Then, the  DMF was exchanged with 40 mL of chloroform and immersed for 12 h  before it was exchanged with fresh chloroform. After 48 h, the chloroform was ltered, and the solid product was dried for 8 h at 90 ℃ in a  convection oven (CO-150, Hanyang Scientic Equipment Co., Ltd, South  Korea).  In the case of UiO-66, metal solution was prepared by dissolving 125  mg of ZrOCl 2 ⋅8H 2 O (0.38 mmol) in 5 mL of DMF with 3 mL of 37% HCl.  Concurrently, 123 mg of BDC (0.74 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL of  DMF, and both solutions were ultra-sonicated for approximately 20 min  (Mujigae  SD-D300H,  Sungdong  Ultrasonics  Co.,  Ltd.,  Seoul,  South  Korea).  Metal  and  linker  solutions  were  mixed  together  and  ultra-  sonicated for an additional 30 min. The resulting solution was heated  for 12 h at 80 ℃. After cooling, the obtained crystals were ltered and  washed  twice  with  30  mL  of  DMF  and  ethanol.  These  crystals  were  soaked in 10 mL of ethanol for 9 days, replenishing at 3-day intervals.  The resulting product was dried at 90  ◦ C for 12 h.  2.3. Characterization of synthesized MOFs  The basic properties of the synthesized MOFs (MOF-5 and UiO-66)  were  assessed  as  crystal  structure,  thermal  stability,  surface  morphology, and chemical functionalities. The powder X-ray diffraction  (PXRD) patterns were obtained by a high-resolution (HR)-XRD diffractometer  (Rigaku  Corporation,  Tokyo,  Japan).  The  HR-PXRD  diffractometer was utilized with a 2θ range of 5, step size of 0.02˚, and a scan  speed of 4˚min − 1 . Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out to  evaluate the thermal stability of MOFs using SDT Q600, Auto-DSCQ20  system (Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA). During TGA analysis, the material  samples  were  placed  on  alumina  pans  and  heated  from  25  to  800  ◦ C at a rate of 10  ◦ C min − 1  under 100 mL atm min − 1  of nitrogen  ow. The surface morphologies of MOFs were investigated using a eld  emission  scanning  electron  microscope  (FE-SEM,  Hillsboro,  Oregon,  USA).  Fourier  transform infrared  (FTIR)  spectroscopy  was  conducted  using a Perkin Elmer L1600400-IR spectrometer (Akron, Ohio, USA) in  attenuated reectance method at a range of 400–4000 cm − 1  to determine  MOF  chemical  functionalities.  Finally,  the  Brunauer-Emmett-  Teller  (BET)-based  surface  properties  of  MOFs  were  obtained  by  analyzing  the  nitrogen  adsorption  isotherms  at  77  K  using  a  Micromeritics ASAP  2010 (Norcross,  Georgia,  USA) surface  analyzer.  The sorbents were heated at 150  ◦ C for 12 h under vacuum condition to  remove moisture.  2.4. Instrumental setup of an AS/TD-GC/MS system for quantitation of  gaseous FA  For the measurement of gaseous FA by the AS/TD-GC/MS system, a  sample  of  the  FA  G-WS  at  a  owrate  of  50  mL  min − 1  was  pre-  concentrated in the cold trap installed in the AS/TD (Unity-xr, Markes  International,  UK)  (Fig.  1).  For this  study,  in-lab  synthesized  UiO-66  MOFs were used as cold-trap sorbents with Tenax®  TA. Note that the  former sorbent was used to efciently capture FA, while the latter was  used to extend the range of target compounds (>5 carbon atoms: e.g.,  benzene, toluene, and  xylene). As such, this  dual cold trap  system  is  highly effective to increase cold trap applicability, especially the number of targets to cover. Likewise, to test the reliability of this UiO-66  relative to  other  MOFs,  in-lab  synthesized MOF-5  sorbents  were  also  used as reference cold-trap sorbents with Tenax® TA in the identical AS/  TD-GC/MS system [17]. For this reason, each dual-bed cold trap was  prepared by placing MOF (front) and Tenax® TA (back) in line with the  sampling  ow  direction  (i.e.,  UiO-66  + Tenax®  TA  and  MOF-5  + Tenax®  TA, 1:1 by volume) in a quartz tube (length: 100 mm, outer  diameter:  3.2  mm,  and  inner  diameter:  2  mm,  Markes  International,  UK). After sampling, the cold trap was heated, and desorbed FA was  injected  into  the  GC  capillary  column  for  separation  (DB-WAX,  lm  thickness: 0.25  μ m, diameter: 0.25 mm, length: 60 m, Agilent, USA) and  quantied by GC/MS (Shimadzu GCMS-QP 2020 Ultra, Kyoto, Japan).  The  GC/MS  analysis  runtime  was  18  min  with  the  GC  temperature  programming summarized in Table S2. The MS system was operated in  electron impact (EI) ionization mode at 70 eV, and FA was detected in  selected ion monitoring mode using the major ions at m/z 29 (fragment  ion) and 30 (molecular ion) (Fig. S1).  2.5. Experimental procedures  To evaluate the AS/TD-GC/MS analytical characteristics using a UiO-  66 + Tenax® TA cold trap, we designed four types of experiments (E1 to  E4) as outlined in Table 1. At E1 (bench testing), the FA adsorption/  breakthrough/recovery  performance  of  UiO-66  and  MOF-5  (as  reference) was evaluated by an established DNPH/HPLC/UV method (i.e.,  prior to TD testing of the MOFs). To optimize the UiO-66 + Tenax® TA  cold trap in the AS/TD-GC/MS system, FA recovery was determined at a  number of trap-low (absorption) and  trap-high  (desorption)  temperature settings of the TD (E2). In E3, QA using the UiO-66 + Tenax® TA  cold trap was applied to assess the reliability of the developed analytical  approach. Before the UiO-66 + Tenax®  TA’s QA experiment was conducted, QA experiment on MOF-5 + Tenax® TA was performed as rst  described  in  previous  studies  of  MOF-5  as  part  of  E3  [17,18].  A  comparative analysis of cold-trap performance indicated the superiority  of UiO-66 + Tenax® TA with extension of breakthrough to 800 mL at  1250 ppb FA (1143 ng). However, MOF-5 + Tenax®  TA exhibited an  immediate breakthrough of 12.7% after loading 250 mL of 1250 ppb FA  (357  ng).  Finally,  the  FA  concentration  in  indoor  air  samples  was  analyzed by the developed UiO-66 + Tenax® TA–based AS/TD-GC/MS  system (E4). The concentration of FA analyzed by UiO-66 + Tenax®  TA–based  AS/TD-GC/MS  was  compared  with  that  obtained  by  the  reference method (DNPH/HPLC/UV).  3. Results and discussion  3.1. MOF characterization  The  crystal  structure,  thermal  stability,  surface  morphology,  and  chemical  functionalities  of  the  synthesized  MOF-5  and  UiO-66  were  determined by PXRD, TGA, SEM, and FTIR, respectively.

UiO-66 synthesis  UiO-66 was synthesised by oil bath. For this purpose, 3 mmol ZrCl 4  and 3 mmol H 2 BDC were mixed in 80 mL DMF. The mixture was stirred  for 1 h to obtain a homogeneous solution. Afterwards the solution was  put into a bottom ask where the reactor was transferred into an oil bath  and kept at 120 ℃  for 24 h. Upon reaching ambient temperature, the  obtained  powder  was  rinsed  with  DMF  and  ethanol  for  three  times.  Lastly, the sample was collected after drying at 80 ℃ for enough time.  2.5. UiO-66/g-C 3 N 4  synthesis  A series of  heterojunction photocatalysts were prepared by  a  solvothermal method in an oil bath with various mass ratios of g-C 3 N 4  to  ZrCl 4 .  Porous  g-C 3 N 4  nanosheet  was  grown  in-situ  onto  UiO-66.  Generally, 4  mmol ZrCl 4  and  4  mmol H 2 BDC were  dissolved in  200  mL DMF. When the mixture was stirred enough time to get a homogeneous solution, a certain amount of porous g-C 3 N 4  powder was mixed  into the dispersion. The suspension was stirred for 1 h and then put into  a bottom ask. After that, the ask was placed in oil bath at 120 ℃ for  24  h  with  continuously  magnetic  stirring.  After  natural  cooling,  the  materials were washed with fresh DMF and ethanol for three times. Then  nal resultant solids were collected after drying and named as CNU-0.2,  CNU-0.5, CNU-1 and CNU-2, according to different ratio of porous g-  C 3 N 4  to ZrCl 4 .  2.6. Photocatalytic property experiments  The photocatalytic property of the sample was investigated by photocatalytic  decomposition  of  organic  dyes  using  RhB  as  a  target  pollutant. In a typical experiment, 20 mg sample was added into 100 mL  RhB solution (60 mg/L). The suspension was then stirred thoroughly for  1 h to reach equilibrium before photocatalysis. Then the mixture was  illuminated under a 300 W xenon lamp using 420 nm glass philtre as  visible light. Then with a regular 10-minute interval, the samples were  extracted and subjected to centrifugation at 8000 rpm for separation.  The clear RhB solution was measured with UV–Vis spectra (λ max  = 550  nm). To investigate the underlying mechanism in this photodegradation  process, BQ, IPA and EDTA-2Na were applied as scavengers to conrm  the active radicals related to this photocatalysis reaction. Each experiment was conducted in triplicate, and the average value was computed  for subsequent analysis.  3. Results and discussion  3.1. Phase analysis  The XRD results of UiO-66, porous g-C 3 N 4  and CNU-X composites  were recorded in Fig. 2a. The ndings indicated that the pattern of UiO-  66 was  coincident  with the  simulated  pattern from literature,  which  meant that the fabrication of this MOF material was successful [34]. The  crystalline structure of the fabricated porous g-C 3 N 4  also agreed well  with the standard structure (JCPDS 87–1526) [35]. Two characteristic  peaks were observed in this pattern. The weak peak at 2θ = 13.1 ◦ was  assigned to the (100) plane and attributed to the tri-s-triazine units,  while the strong peak at 2θ  = 27.2 ◦ , indicating the (002) plane, represented the typical graphitic layered structure [36]. Moreover, in the  series  of  g-C 3 N 4 /UiO-66  composite  samples,  the  pronounced  peaks  related  to  UiO-66  and  g-C 3 N 4  could  be  distinctly  identied,  and  no  additional impurities were detected, indicating that the original crystallinity of  the parent  compound was  maintained,  and no  additional  impurities generated in the preparation process. Moreover, the peak at  2θ = 27.2 ◦ of g-C 3 N 4  became more distinct with the increment of g-C 3 N 4  ratio, indicating that the precursor components were combined closely  to form a composite rather than just mixing together [37]. In addition,  an FTIR  spectrum  was obtained to conrm  the  functionalities of the  materials. It was illustrated in Fig.2b that the spectra analysis conrmed  the existence of the basic structures of g-C 3 N 4  and UiO-66 in the nanohybrids.  The peak  at  810  cm − 1  of  the  CNU-X  nanohybrids  could  be  corresponding to the s-triazine units  in  g-C 3 N 4 , and the peaks in the  region of 1200 to 1700 cm − 1  could be assigned to the skeletal vibrations  of C-N rings in g-C 3 N 4  [38]. Moreover, the characteristic peaks between  Fig. 3. SEM of (a) porous g-C 3 N 4 , (b) pristine UiO-66, (c-e) CNU-0.5 nanohybrid.   D. Lan et al.",

    "paragraph": "      Chemical Physics 543 (2021) 111093 2  Ltd and used without further purication, and deionized water was used  in all experiments.  2.2. Synthesis of UiO-66 and UiO-66-X(X = NH 2 , NO 2 , NH 2  and NO 2 )  Materials  were  synthesized  following  procedures  previously  reported [30]. First of all, to a 20 mL vial was sequentially added 142  μ l of  a 70% zirconium propoxide (Zr(OnPr) 4 ) solution in 1-propanol (0.158  mmol), 14 mL DMF and 8 mL acetic acid. The sample bottle was heated  at 150  ◦ C for 2 h in an aluminum foil package, and the solution turned  yellow. Then, the solution was cooled down to room temperature followed by addition of the desired terephthalic acid (75 mg), terephthalic  acid (75 mg) and 2-amino-terephthalic acid (82 mg) (molar ratio is 1:1),  terephthalic acid (75 mg) and 2-nitro-terephthalic acid (95 mg) (molar  ratio is 1:1), 2-amino-terephthalic acid (82 mg) and 2-nitro-terephthalic  acid (95 mg) (molar ratio is 1:1) respectively and sonicated for 30 s.  Next,  the  abovementioned  solution  was  stirred  continuously  with  a  magnetic stirrer at 300 rpm for 18 h at 25  ◦ C. Finally, the adsorbent was  separated  from  the  supernatant  by  centrifugation  and  was  washed  several times with DMF and solvent exchanged with ethanol. Samples  were then heated in a vacuum drying oven at 80  ◦ C for several times to  obtain a white powder.  2.3. Characterization  The samples were characterized by SEM, XRD, Fourier transformed  infrared  spectroscopy  (FT-IR),  Brunauer-Emmett-Teller  (BET)  surface  area and the pore volume and contact angle test. The morphologies and  microstructures were observed using SEM (Hitachi S4800). The crystal  structures and compositions of the samples were analyzed by powder X-  ray diffraction (XRD) (Bruker D2 Focus Powder X-ray diffractometer).  The laser light source  is  CuK α  radiation (λ  = 0.15405 nm), the tube  voltage is 40 kV, and the tube current is 40 mA. The crystal functional  groups were analyzed by Fourier Infrared Spectrometer (SP 2000, USA).  The nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms were obtained using  the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method at 77 K after degassing the  samples at 100  ◦ C for 4 h by an analyzer (Quantachrome, Quadrasorb  evo, Boynton Beach, FL, USA). The hydrophilicity of the samples water  contact  angle  tests  were  conducted  using  XG-CAMB3  Contact  Anglemete.  The  volume  of  the  drops  of  water  was  3  μ l  and  photos  were  recorded 10 s after drip, the test was repeated 3 times and the average  was reported.  2.4. Adsorption of water  Adsorption isotherms of water were measured with a water vapor  adsorption  analyzer  (AQUADYNE  DVS-2)  at  298  K.  Before  the  measurement, the samples were evacuated under vacuum for 12 h at 80  ◦ C.  The measurement humidity range is 2% RH ~ 90% RH.  3. Results and discussion  3.1. Charcterization of UiO-66 and UiO-66-X (X = NH 2 , NO 2 , NH 2  and  NO 2 )  SEM and XRD were used to study the micromorphology and lattice  structure of UiO-66 and UiO-66-X (X = NH 2 , NO 2 , NH 2  and NO 2 ) crystalline power.  Fig.  1 shows  the  SEM  images  of  UiO-66,  UiO-66-NH 2 ,  UiO-66-NO 2  and  UiO-66-(NH 2  + NO 2 ).  All  samples  exhibit  a  similar  crystalline  morphology  with  homogeneous  smooth  cubic  shape  at  different sizes. UiO-66 present particle size around 100 nm, while the  size of UiO-66 decreased after introducing functionalized groups. UiO-  66-(NH 2  + NO 2 ) exhibited the smallest crystal size, however, it aggregated severely.  Fig. 2 shows the XRD pattern of the UiO-66, UiO-66-NH 2 , UiO-66-  NO 2  and UiO-66-(NH 2  + NO 2 ), which shows a crystalline state with the  same peak position as reported in the literature [31]. From the XRD  pattern, it could nd the several main peaks are one-to-one correspondence, but the intensity reduced a little in presence of functional groups.  It  is  conrmed  that  the  functional  groups  have  not  change  crystal  structure of UiO-66. The little broadness of the UiO-66-(NH 2  + NO 2 )  peaks is a result of the smaller sizes of the particles, which is agree with  the results of SEM images.  Fig. 3 show FTIR spectra of UiO-66, UiO-66-NH 2 , UiO-66-NO 2  and  UiO-66-(NH 2  + NO 2 ) samples. The strong absorption band at 1657 cm − 1  assigned  to  the  stretching  vibration  of  C – – O  bond  from  DMF  was  observed. The shear expansion of the unique C – N stretching in the aromatic amine appears at 1267 cm − 1 . The peak of UiO-66-NO 2  at 1540  cm − 1  belongs to the asymmetric stretching vibration of nitro. It is proved  that  the  UiO-66-NH 2 ,  UiO-66-NO 2  and  UiO-66-(NH 2  + NO 2 )  were  Fig. 1. SEM images of (a) UiO-66, (b) UiO-66-NH 2 , (c) UiO-66-NO 2  and (d) UiO-66-(NH 2  + NO 2 ).   X.

Then the organic solvent was removed by using a rotary evaporator, and hydrochloric acid (37% w/w) was added dropwise into the  remaining solution until pH = 1. The nal yellow product was further  washed using DI water and later dried in the lyophilizer overnight to  remove the residual solvent.  2.3. Synthesis of zirconium-based metal-organic frameworks  The  VNU-1  synthesis  procedure  is  based  on  previously  reported  methods [16]. Two aqueous solutions had been prepared while solution  A contained a mixture of 109 mg (0.340 mmol) ZrOCl 2 ⋅8 H 2 O, 5 mL  acetic acid, and 20 mL DMF solvent, and solution B was prepared by  dissolving 124 mg (0.340 mmol) H 2 CPEB linker in 15 mL DMF solvent.  After sonicated for 30 min, both solutions A and B were mixed into a  100 mL Duran®  glass bottle and heated under 120  ◦ C for 1 day in an  isothermal oven. The as-synthesized VNU-1 was centrifuged under 20,  000  rpm  for 5  min  with  DMF three  times  and  MeOH  one  time, and  further  dried  in  the  lyophilizer  for  one  day  to  remove  the  residual  solvent.  The procedure for the synthesis of the UiO series MOFs was based on  previous literature [17,19,44]. In a typical UiO-67 synthesis procedure,  93.2 mg (0.4 mmol) of ZrCl 4  was rst dissolved in 0.38 mL acetic acid  and 5 mL DMF solvent. 96.8 mg (0.4 mmol) of H 2 BPDC linker were then  dissolved in 10 mL DMF solvent. Both aqueous solutions were further  mixed in a 50 mL vial and heated under 120  ◦ C in an isothermal oven for  1 day after 30 min ultrasonication. For UiO-66, 0.111 g (0.343 mmol) of  ZrOCl 2 ⋅8 H 2 O and 0.8377 g (6.86 mol) of benzoic acid were dissolved in  20 mL DMF solvent. Then 0.057 g (0.343 mmol) of H 2 BDC were added  and sonicated until they dissolved. The aqueous solution was heated  under 120 ℃ for 1 day to form UiO-66. UiO-66-NH 2  were synthesized  under similar conditions with the previous MOFs. 138 mg (0.428 mmol)  of ZrOCl 2 ⋅8 H 2 O were dissolved into 24 mL acetic acid and 36 mL DMF  solvents. After fully dissolved, 77.6 mg (0.428 mmol) H 2 BDC-NH 2  were  added  and  sonicated  for  another  30  min.  The  mixture  solution  was  heated  under  120  ◦ C  for  1  day  to  synthesize  UiO-66-NH 2 .  All  the  as-synthesized UiO series MOFs were centrifuged with DMF solvent 3  times and MeOH 1 time under 20,000 rpm for 5 min and further vacuumed in lyophilizer for overnight.  2.4. Characterization of metal-organic frameworks  The functional group of H 2 CPEB organic compound was measured by  a Bruker 500 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance with TMS as standard.  The sample was prepared by dissolving the H 2 CPEB organic linker into  deuterated solvent (CDCl 3 ) and ltrated by a 0.22 µm nylon lter into  the NMR tube. Wide-angle patterns of powder X-Ray diffraction (XRD)  were measured by Rigaku Ultima IV with Cu K α  radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å)  to identify the crystallinity of all Zr-based MOFs. The operation condition was xed at a generator voltage of 40 kV and an emission current of  40 mA. The X-ray diffraction results were recorded in the angle range  (2θ) from 3 ◦ to 50 ◦ with a scan rate of 20  ◦ min -1 . The morphology of all  Zr-based MOFs was observed with applying FE-SEM (Nova™ NanoSEM  230). Before SEM observation, the samples on the holder were sputtered  by Pt metal for 2 min under 20 mA to increase the electric conductivity  of samples. The operating voltage was set between 5 and 10 kV and the  spot size was 3.0–4.0. The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm was  measured with BELSORP-series. The specic surface area was evaluated  by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method and the pore size distribution  was  estimated  by  the  non-linear  density  functional  theory  (NLDFT).  The  samples  were  degassed  at  120  ◦ C  for  8  h  under  high  vacuum  (0.1  Pa)  and  kept  at  77  K  during  measurement.  The  UV–VIS–NIR spectrophotometer (JASCO V-670) was applied to measure  the light-harvesting properties of Zr-based MOFs between wavelengths  of 250–850 nm. The baseline was measured and offset with the sample  by  using BaSO 4  because of  its  near-perfect diffuse  reectance  in  the  250–2500 nm  wavelength range. The  emission wavelengths  between  350 and 600 nm of Zr-based MOFs were measured by using the photoluminescence (PL) with a pulse laser excitation wavelength of 375 nm. A  lter was added on the detector to ltrate the signal below 400 nm. The  lifetime  of  different  MOFs  was  measured  by  time-resolved  photoluminescence with  a  channel resolution  of 4 ps.  The laser  excitation  wavelength was xed at 375 nm, and the detected emission wavelength  of every MOF was depended on the highest emission wavelength evaluated  by  photoluminescence  spectra.  The  X-ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy (XPS) was performed with a micro focused electron gun and the  multi  position  aluminum  anode  along  with  a  monochromated  X-ray  source. The XPS spectra at the lowest energy were analyzed to obtain the  valence band maxima (VBM), and the conduction band minima (CBM)  was derived from the formula of CBM = CBM + Eg, where Eg was the  energy gap identied in the tauc plot [14,57]. All the samples were dried  under vacuum for 1 day before measuring.  2.5. Adsorption and photocatalytic reaction test  Sulfamethoxazole adsorption and photocatalytic reaction was done  by  SUNTEST  CPS+ sunlight  simulator  with  a  xenon  lamp  under the  conditions of pH 7, ambient temperature, a wavelength from 300 nm to  800 nm and light intensity of 700 W/m 2 . 10 mg of Zr-based MOF were  added into a quartz beaker with 100 mL sulfamethoxazole solution (80  ppb). Before the light irradiation, the suspension was stirred vigorously  under dark condition for an hour to reach adsorption-desorption equilibrium,  then  the  light  was  switched  on  to  run  the  photocatalytic  degradation for 30 min. During the reaction, 0.5 mL of suspension was  taken out at intervals and ltered through a 0.22 µm PVDF membrane  for  further  analysis.  The  sulfamethoxazole  concentration  was  determined based on the LC-MS/MS analysis. The eluent solution was prepared by mixing methanol and deionized water solution with different  volume  ratios  under  different  time,  the  details  were  arranged  in  Table S1. Blank control experiments were done in the absence of catalysts under the same condition. All the experiments were repeated three  times and averaged to get the data points.  2.6. Size-selective test  To study the size-selective property of VNU-1, three different molecule size of antibiotics (SMX, AMP, and LIN) with a concentration of 80  ppb were added along with the big molecule humic acid (20 ppm) into  DI water to form a mixture system. 10 mg of VNU-1 was added into the  mixture solution and stir for 1 h to reach adsorption-desorption equilibrium, followed by a photocatalytic reaction for 1 h. The reaction was  done under the same conditions as the adsorption and photodegradation  experiments. During the reaction, 0.5 mL of suspension is taken out and  ltered through a 0.22 µm PVDF membrane for LC-MS/MS and LC-DAD  analysis.  The eluent solution was prepared by mixing the methanol and 10  mM ammonia bicarbonate in the deionized water solution with different  volume ratios under different time, and  the details were  arranged in  Table S2.  Blank  control  experiments  were  done  in  the  absence  of  catalysts  under the same condition. The result was compared with the commercial  photocatalyst (Degussa P25) to compare the selectivity properties.  2.7. Total organic carbon and Microtox® test  The  mineralization  of  the  antibiotics  was  measured  using  total  organic carbon (TOC) analyser. The experiment was done by preparing  two solutions. The rst solution, solution A, contained 20 mg of VNU-1  and 3 different antibiotics (SMX, AMP, LIN), each with 10 ppm concentration. Solution B acted as a background that contained only 20 mg  of VNU-1 photocatalyst without adding any antibiotics. After adsorbing  in dark condition for 2 h and light irradiation for 2 h, the TOC analysis  has  been  measured.  The  actual  TOC  value  was  then  calculated  by  J.-X. Tan et al.",

The resulting white powder was dried under vacuum at 423 K for 12 h.The argon plasma was generated by using a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD). The pristine MOF samples were added into the DBD plasma reactor and treated under a dynamic argon plasma atmosphere.The peak-to-peak applied voltage was 20 kV with a sinusoidal waveform at a frequency of about 10 kHz. More detailed procedures for the DBD plasma treatment can be found in our previous works [26]. The infrared imaging was applied to measure the bulk temperature of the DBD plasma. The highest temperature measured is lower than 398 K, similar to that reported previously [27]. The thermal eﬀect of the DBD plasma treatment can therefore be ignored on the thermally stable UiO66.",

The NCM-WIT was obtained by adding 2.4 mL of 37%  HCl  (29  mmol)  and  DOBDC  6.42  g  (32.4  mmol),  and  the  resulting  samples were named NCM-WIT-A, NCM-WIT-B, NCM-WIT-C at crystallization  temperature  120  ◦ C,  170  ◦ C  or  220  ◦ C,  respectively.  The  U-(OH) 2  was obtained by increasing to 30 mL of 37% HCl (363 mmol)  and the organic ligand DOBDC (32.4 mmol), which were crystallized for  20 h at 120  ◦ C, 170  ◦ C or 220  ◦ C, respectively, and the obtained crystals  were named as U-(OH) 2 -A, U-(OH) 2 -B, U-(OH) 2 -C(X) (X indicates that it  was the non-crystalline structure or amorphous structure).  2.3. Adsorption and regeneration experiments  All adsorption experiments were performed at an ambient temperature of 25 ◦ C, and the effects of solutions at different pH, adsorption  time and initial MB concentration on adsorption were investigated. First,  the effect of solution pH from 3 to 11 adjusted with 2 mol⋅L − 1  HCl and  NaOH solutions was studied on the adsorption process. The adsorption  performance  was  investigated  by  adding  20 mg  of  the  adsorbent  to  50 mL of a MB solution with a concentration of 400 mg⋅L − 1 . Second, the  adsorbent  materials  of  20 mg  were  added  into  50 mL  MB  solution  (pH=7, C=400 mg⋅L − 1 ) to determine the adsorption kinetics (0–6 h). At  Fig. 2.

UiO-66 is characterized by very high surface area, excellent thermal stability, resistant to many chemicals and preserves crystalline morphology after exposure to high external pressures (Cavka et al., 2008; Valenzano et al., 2011). This high stability of UiO-66 and porous morphology of MOFs motivated our interest in investigating its functional derivative potential as enzyme cellulase carrier without further chemical modiﬁcation.2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials Cellulase originated from Trichoderma reesei (10,000 U/g) was purchased from Macklin Biochemical (Shanghai, China); D-glucose, carboxymethyl cellulose, 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS), sodium bisul ﬁte, 3,5-dinitro-salicylic acid, potassium sodium tartate tetrahydrate, sodium nitrite, zirconium chloride (ZrCl 4 ), 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid and 2-amino benzene dicarboxylic acid, were purchased from Aladdin Chemicals (Shanghai, China).2.2.

Zirconium tetrachloride (ZrCl 4 , 98%), potassium  bromide  (KBr,  98.5%),  glacial  acetic  acid  (>99%),  toluene  (99.5%),  acetone (≥99%) were provided by Merck Life Science Pvt.Ltd. Mumbai,  India.  Polyvinylpyrrolidone  K30  (PVP,  Mw  = 55,000,  90%)  was  obtained  from  Spectrochem  Pvt.Ltd.  Mumbai,  India.  N,  N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99%), 2-methylfuran (98%) were purchased from  Avra  chemicals  Pvt.Ltd.  Hyderabad,  India.  potassium  chloride  (KCl,  99.5%) and 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H 2 BDC, 98%) were procured  from NICE chemicals and Alfa Aesar respectively. All the chemicals were  used as obtained without purication.  2.2. Synthetic procedures  2.2.1. Synthesis of UiO-66(Hf) MOF  Microcrystalline UiO-66(Hf) MOF material was synthesized via solvothermal method with slight modication in the reported procedure  [66]. Typically, HfCl 4  (208 mg, 0.65 mmol) and H 2 BDC (108 mg, 0.65  mmol) were added to a teon-lined reactor (50 mL) followed by the  addition of DMF (8.3 mL) &  formic acid (2.17 mL). This mixture was  stirred for 15 min to facilitate the complete dissolution of the precursors.  Then the reactor was sealed and placed in an oven maintained at 120  ◦ C  for 48 h. Thereafter, the reactor was allowed to cool to room temperature (RT). The microcrystalline powder of UiO-66(Hf) was isolated from  the  reaction  mixture  by  centrifugation  &  washed  thoroughly  using  acetone to remove the residual reactants. Subsequently, the collected  powdered material was dried under vacuum.  2.2.2. Synthesis of UiO-66(Zr) MOF  The UiO-66(Zr) was synthesized by solvothermal method. Typically,  222.7 mg of ZrCl 4  (0.955 mmol) and 166.7 mg H 2 BDC (1 mmol) were  added to a 100 mL screw capped bottle followed by the addition of 66.6  mL of DMF solvent and 4.66 mL of acetic acid. The mixture was sonicated for 10 min to  aid the complete  dispersion of precursors in the  solvent. Then the bottle was sealed and kept in a pre-heated oven at  100  ◦ C for  24 h. After completion of  the reaction, the screw  capped  bottle was removed from the oven and allowed to cool to RT. Later, the  supernatant was decanted and the UiO-66(Zr) MOF was isolated from  the mixture by centrifugation. Then, the obtained material was washed  with DMF and methanol twice (15 mL each), and dried under the vacuum at RT.  2.2.3. Synthesis of Pd nanoparticles (Pd-NPs)  Pd-NPs were synthesized by following the reported procedure [67].  At rst, the aqueous solution of Pd precursor was prepared by dissolving  228  mg  (0.77  mmol)  of  Na 2 PdCl 4  in  12  mL  distilled  water.  Then,  a  mixture of 420 mg (3.85 mmol) of PVP, 300 mg (2.52 mmol) of KBr, 240  mg (1.36 mmol) of  L-ascorbic acid, and 564 mg (7.56 mmol) of KCl were  added to a 100 mL round-bottom ask containing 32 mL of distilled  water.  This  mixture  is  heated  at  80  ◦ C  under  constant  stirring  and  maintained at this temperature for 10 min. Subsequently, the dropwise  addition of Pd(II) precursor solution to the above clear solution is performed under constant stirring (within 10 min). Further, the reaction is  allowed to proceed for 3h at 80  ◦ C to facilitate the formation of Pd NPs.  Later,  the  colloidal  system  containing  Pd  NPs  was  cooled  and  the  nanoparticles were isolated by centrifugation. The obtained product was  washed with excess of acetone and distilled water. The washed nanoparticles were dried at RT under vacuum.  2.2.4. Synthesis of Pd nanoparticles supported on UiO-66(Hf) MOF [Pd/  UiO-66(Hf)]  In a typical synthesis, 20 mg of Pd-NPs were added to 10 mL of DMF  and it is sonicated for 15 min to make uniform distribution of NPs. Later,  380 mg of activated (vacuum dried) UiO-66(Hf) sample was added to  the Pd-NPs solution and stirred vigorously for 2h at RT. Afterwards, this  reaction mixture was centrifuged to collect the catalytic material. Then,  the obtained product was washed thoroughly with excess of acetone,  dried under vacuum at RT, and designated as Pd/UiO-66 (Hf).  2.2.5. Synthesis of core-shell Pd@UiO-66(Hf) material  In a typical procedure, HfCl 4  (208 mg, 0.65 mmol) and H 2 BDC (108  mg, 0.65 mmol) were added to a vial (30 mL) containing DMF (8.3 mL)  & formic acid (2.17 mL). This mixture was stirred for 15 min to get the  clear solution of precursors. Then 8 mg of Pd-NPs were weighed and  transferred to the above solution and sonicated for 15 min to facilitate  the dispersion. Later, this dispersed solution was transferred to a teon-  lined reactor (50 mL). The reactor containing the solution was sealed  and heated at 120  ◦ C in an oven for 48 h. Thereafter, the reactor was  allowed to cool to RT. The microcrystalline powder was isolated from  the reaction mixture by centrifugation & thoroughly washed ve times  with acetone (30 mL each) to remove the residual reactants. Finally, the  collected material was dried under vacuum and designated as Pd@UiO-  66(Hf).  2.2.6. Synthesis of Pd@UiO-66(Zr) material  In a typical procedure, 222.7 mg of ZrCl 4  (0.955 mmol), 166.7 mg  H 2 BDC (1 mmol), and 4.66 mL of acetic acid were taken in a 100 mL  screw capped bottle. Subsequently, 66.6 mL of DMF solvent was added  and this mixture was sonicated for about 10 min to aid the dispersion of  precursors. To the above solution, 14 mg of as-synthesized Pd NPs were  added and again sonicated for 15 min. Later, the screw-capped bottle  containing black coloured solution was placed in a pre-heated oven at  100  ◦ C for 24 h. On completion of the reaction, the bottle was taken out  and allowed  to  cool  to  RT. Further,  the  obtained  solid  material  was  collected  by  decanting  the  supernatant  followed  by  centrifugation.  Then, the material was washed with DMF and methanol twice (15 mL  each) followed  by drying under  vacuum at RT. Finally, the obtained  material was designated as Pd@UiO-66(Zr).  2.3. Characterization  The Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the materials were  collected on the Bruker D2 Phaser diffractometer. The PXRD patterns of  the samples were recorded using Cu-K α  radiation (λ = 1.542 Å) in the 2θ  range of 5 ◦ –90 ◦ (step increment of 0.02 ◦ & at the rate of 0.3 Sec step − 1 ).  The BET specic surface area (SSA), pore size (PS) distribution, and pore  volume (PV) were measured using Belsorb (II) mini-instrument (BEL,  Japan). The N 2  sorption analysis was performed using liquid-N 2  at 77K  temperature. Prior to the measurements, samples were outgassed for 10  h  at  150  ◦ C  under  vacuum.  X-ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy  (XPS)  spectra of the materials were acquired on ULVAC PHI/PHI5000 Versa  Probell instrument with monochromatic Al K α  radiation of 1486.6 eV  photon energy and X-ray spot size of 100  μ m. The low resolution survey  spectra  were  collected  with  187.85  eV  pass  energy  and  later  high-  resolution scans for each element were recorded. The binding energies  of each element in the materials were calibrated by taking C 1s peak at  284.5 eV as a reference. The actual Pd content in MOF catalysts were  measured  by  ICP-OES  (Inductively  coupled  plasma-optical  emission  spectroscopy) analysis using PerkinElmer Optima 7000 DV instrument.  The thermal  stability of the  pristine  MOF and hybrid materials  were  determined by TGA (Thermogravimetric analysis) analysis on a PerkinElmer, STA6000  instrument. Analyses were  performed  under N 2  atmosphere  with  20  mL  min − 1  ow  rate  in  the  temperature  range  of  30–800  ◦ C with 10  ◦ C min − 1  ramp rate. The HR-TEM (high-resolution  transmission  electron  microscopy)  images  were  recorded  on  a  JEOL  JEM-2100 PLUS electron microscope at the operating voltage of 200 kV.  The acidic properties of the MOFs and hybrid materials were determined  by  NH 3 -TPD  (NH 3 - temperature  programmed  reduction)  measurements using Belcat II (BEL Japan) instrument. Firstly, prior to the  measurements, around 50 mg of the sample was mounted in a quartz U-  tube and pre-treated at 200  ◦ C for 2 h in a helium (He) atmosphere.  Later, the sample was cooled to 50  ◦ C, which was subsequently ushed  with 10% NH 3 /He for 30 min. The physisorbed NH 3  was removed at  B.B. Kulkarni et al.",

Methanol (99.9%) was purchased from Fischer Chemical. TCI chemicals of 2-methylfuran (2-MF), 1,2-pentanediol (1,2-PeD),  and 1,5-pentanediol (1,5-PeD) were kindly received from Dr. Rodiansono  research  group  at  Lambung  Mangkurat  University,  South  Kalimantan,  Indonesia.  All  reagents  were  used  as  received  without  any  further purication. The level of purities in solvents was re-conrmed by  gas chromatography (GC), while one in linkers was by  1 H NMR.  Synthesis of DUT-52, UiO-66, and MOF-808  DUT-52 was prepared solvothermally according to a published procedure [34], with a slight modication. Zirconium(IV) chloride (1.07 g,  4.6 mmol) was dissolved in 40 mL DMF under a nitrogen atmosphere. An  organic linker of H 2 NDC (0.99 g, 4.6 mmol) was added to the mixture  and stirred at room temperature (28  ◦ C) until the solution was clear.  Afterward, HCl 1,2 M (0.4 mL) was added to the mixture. The mixture  was placed in 100 mL Schott glass and heated at 120  ◦ C for 20 h at  ambient  pressure.  The  obtained  solid  was  ltered and washed  three  times with DMF (15 mL) and ethanol (5 mL) to remove the unreacted  linker.  The  powder  was  immersed  in  25  mL  of  chloroform  at  room  temperature  for  4  h,  and  the  solvent  was  replaced  twice.  The  solid  powder was dried at 120  ◦ C for 30 min in the oven, resulting in white  powders of MOF (1.83 g). Finally, the MOF was reheated at 140  ◦ C for 6  h under N 2  ow to remove the remaining guest molecules from pores  before  catalytic  tests.  Other  MOFs,  i.e.,  UiO-66  and  MOF-808,  were  synthesized  according  to  published  methods  [32,53]  with  a  slight  modication in UiO-66, i.e., by adding a concentrated HCl (2 equimolar  of ZrCl 4 ). After the precipitate was formed, a drying process and solvent  replacement  by  chloroform  were  employed.  Formations  of  MOFs  structures were conrmed by powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD). MOFs  were  then  reheated at 140  ◦ C  for  6 h under N 2  ow  to  remove the  trapped solvent. DUT-52 was also prepared in modied forms, i.e., by  reuxing DUT-52 for 6 h in methanol (65  ◦ C) and 2-propanol (80  ◦ C),  respectively. The one reuxed in methanol was labeled DUT-52_MeOH,  while one reuxed in 2-propanol was labeled DUT-52_IPA. The amount  of Zr in the MOF was calculated using a gravimetric method (Supplementary Material, Table S2 &  S3), i.e. 0.1 g of MOF was calcined at  600  ◦ C for 6 h to give ZrO 2  [54]. Formations of ZrO 2  and its phases (i.e.,  monoclinic or tetragonal ZrO 2 ) were conrmed by PXRD. The number of  ZrO 2  was taken as a representation of the mole of Zr in the MOF per  initial mass.  Characterizations  Synthesized Zr-MOFs, recycled Zr-MOFs, and calcined Zr-MOFs were  characterized by PXRD (Rigaku Miniex600, Cu K α  with D/teX ultra 1-D  detector, operated at 40 kV and 15 mA) and Fourier transform infrared  (FTIR; Bruker Alpha with ZnSe beam splitter and 2 cm − 1  resolution).  XRD patterns were recorded at 2θ of 3− 60  ◦ , with a step width of 0.02  ◦ and scanning speed of 10  ◦ min − 1 . Estimated pore diameters and surface  areas of the MOFs were obtained from N 2  physisorption isotherms at 77  K (Micromeritics). For FTIR measurement, samples were immersed in  potassium  bromide  powder  with  a  KBr  background  correction  and  measured for 16 scans.  Computational details  Computational  calculations  were  performed  by  using  an  approximate density-functional theory method, i.e., the extended tight-binding  (xTB) method [55–58]. The method was sufciently accurate to describe  many organometallic systemsand MOFs as calculated by the Grimme  group, with the margin error of only 4 kcal/mol [58]. Calculations of  such a system by DFT/B3LYP-D3 have been reported to result in a larger  error margin of 6 kcal/mol [58]. Initial structures were optimized at the  second  generation  xTB  method,  namely,  GFN2-xTB  that  utilizes  the  approximate  Slater  functions,  polarization  functions,  as  well  as  describing hypervalent states [57]. The DUT-52 and UiO-66 frameworks  were modeled as cluster structures as adopted from our previous work  [40]. The adopted  DUT-52  and UiO-66 structures  were  optimized at  GFN2-xTB level. During the geometry optimizations, all zirconium and  terminal oxygen atoms  in the carboxylic  groups were constrained  to  retain the framework environment. The initial 2-propanol structure was  optimized  under  the  same  computational  condition.  The  optimized  structure was added to DUT-52 and UiO-66 frameworks. To facilitate an  electron pair donation from 2-propanol, a linker from each MOF was  rstly removed, providing a molecular SBU with 11-coordination.  The enthalpy and Gibbs free energies of all optimized structures were  obtained by performing numerical Hessian calculations at the GFN2-xTB  level.  Temperatures  of  298.15  and  413.15  K  were  used  for  thermochemical  properties  calculation.  The  evaluation  of  Lewis  acidity  of  adjacent Zr atoms to the one coordinated by 2-propanol was done by  electrostatic  potential  (ESP)  charges  and  Wiberg  bond  order  (WBO)  calculations at the GFN2-xTB level.  Catalytic test and product analysis  In a typical procedure, DUT-52 (75 mg, 6 mol% of Zr(IV)), FALD  (0.29 g, 3 mmol), 2-propanol (10 mL), and naphthalene (0.064 g, 0.5  mmol)  as  an  internal  standard  were  placed  in  a  50  mL  Teon-lined  stainless steel autoclave. The mixture was stirred (500 rpm) and heated at the desired temperature for a specic time. After the reaction, solid  and liquid phases were separated using a centrifuge (1000 rpm for 30  minutes).  The  used  catalyst  was  rinsed  three  times  thoroughly  with  ethanol (30 mL) and dried at 120  ◦ C for 30 min for a recycle test. FOL  products and remaining  FALD  were analyzed using  Perkin-Elmer  GC  with a ame ionization detector (FID) and an SGE EN5MS (5% optimized  silphenylene)  capillary  column  (30  m  x  0.25  mm  x  0.5  μ m).  Injector and detector were set at 250  ◦ C and 275  ◦ C, respectively. The  oven temperature was set at 100  ◦ C for 2 min, then raised to 105  ◦ C at a  rate of 0.5  ◦ C/min for 1 min and from 105  ◦ C to 170  ◦ C at a rate of 15  ◦ C/  min for 2 min. FALD conversions and FOL yields were determined by  calibration curves, using naphthalene as an internal standard (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1). The obtained FOL was also conrmed by  1 H-  NMR  (60  MHz;  Nanalysis  NMReady-60e)  with  CDCl 3  as  a  d-solvent.  Possible byproducts were conrmed by GC-FID using authentic samples  of THFA, 2-MF, 1,2-PeD, and 1,5-PeD.  Result and discussion  Synthesis and Characterization of Catalysts  Zr-MOFs  of  DUT-52,  UiO-66,  and  MOF-808  were  prepared  solvothermally  in  DMF  at  120  ◦ C  for  20  to  48  h.  They  were  initially  reheated at 140  ◦ C for 6 h under N 2  ow before catalytic evaluations to  optimize the accessibility of FALD into MOFs pores.  DUT-52,  UiO-66,  and MOF-808 were characterized by  PXRD  and  compared with their simulated single-crystal patterns. The 2θ values of  DUT-52 are similar to its simulated pattern, represented by d 111  and d 200  reections at 6.4  ◦ and 7.4  ◦ , respectively (Fig. 1a). PXRD patterns of  UiO-66 and MOF-808 depicted typical 2θ  values at 7.3  ◦ and 8.5  ◦ for  UiO-66  and  8.3  ◦ and  8.7  ◦ for  MOF-808  (Supplementary  Material,  Fig. S2). FTIR spectrum of DUT-52 is given in Fig 1b compared to its  organic linker (H 2 NDC). Coordinated-carboxylate at DUT-52 showed a  weaker  C=O  vibration  (1565  cm − 1 )  than  its  free  one  (1685  cm − 1 ;  Fig. 1b.), indicating a weakened-bond order at carbonyl moiety after  metal-linker  coordination.  Analogous  phenomena  were  observed  in  UiO-66 and MOF-808  (Supplementary Material, Fig. S3.). Zirconium-  oxygen  vibrations  of  oxo-hydroxo  ligands  of  Zr  in  SBUs  of  K.D. Agusta et al.",

After the autoclave was cooled to  room temperature naturally, the product was centrifuged and washed  with DMF and methanol at least three times, respectively. The obtained  white solid powder was recovered after vacuum drying at 60  ◦ C. UiO-66  (Zr)  with  different  defectiveness  was  synthesized  using  different  amounts of acetic acid.  UiO-66(Hf) was synthesized with a strategy similar to UiO-66(Zr),  except for using a corresponding amount of HfCl 4 .  UiO-66(Ce) was synthesized according to the method reported previously [29]. 35.4 mg (0.213 mmol) H 2 BDC was introduced to the glass  reactor with 1.2 mL DMF, then 400  μ L 0.53 M aqueous solution of Ce  (NH 4 ) 2 (NO 3 ) 6 . The glass reactor was heated under magnetic stirring for  15 min at 100  ◦ C. The light-yellow precipitate was centrifuged in the  mother suspension, then the solid was washed with DMF and ethanol  three times, respectively. The solid was dried in air at 60  ◦ C.  MOF-801 was synthesized according to the method reported previously [30]. 81 mg (0.70 mmol) fumaric acid and 230 mg (0.70 mmol)  ZrOCl 2 •8H 2 O were dissolved in a solvent mixture of DMF/formic acid  (35 mL/5.3 mL) and placed in a 60 mL screw-capped glass jar, which  was heated at 120  ◦ C for 24 h in the oven. The obtained white powder  was  collected  and  quickly  washed  three  times  with  fresh  DMF  and  further dried at 60  ◦ C.  UiO-67  was  synthesized  according  to the  method  reported  previously with a little modication [28]. 140 mg (0.6 mmol) ZrCl 4  and 141  mg (0.6 mmol) H 2 BPDC were dissolved in 25 mL DMF, respectively.  After combining the two solutions, 2.20 g benzoic acid was added to the  mixture under stirring. The solution was ultrasonicated until fully dissolved. Subsequently, the solution was transferred to a 50 mL autoclave,  sealed and heated at 120  ◦ C for 24 h. After the autoclave was cooled to  room temperature naturally, the product was centrifuged and washed  with DMF and methanol at least three times, respectively. The white  solid powder was collected after vacuum drying at 60  ◦ C.  UiO-66-NH 2 , UiO-66-NO 2 , and UiO-66-Br were synthesized with a  strategy similar to UiO-66(Zr), except for using corresponding amounts  of H 2 BDC – NH 2 , H 2 BDC – NO 2 , and H 2 BDC-Br.  UiO-66-(OH) 2  was synthesized according to the  method  reported  previously [31]. 125 mg (0.75 mmol) ZrCl 4  and 147 mg (0.75 mmol)  H 2 BDC-(OH) 2  and 1.0  mL  concentrated  HCl  was  dissolved  in  15  mL  DMF, the mixture was  ultrasonicated  until  fully  dissolved  and  transferred to 8-dram vial, sealed and heated at 100  ◦ C for 8 h. After the  reaction was completed, the product was centrifuged and washed with  DMF and methanol at least three times, respectively. The white solid  powder was collected after vacuum drying at 60  ◦ C.  Characterizations  Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were recorded on Bruker  D8 Advance with Cu K α  radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) operating at 40 kV and  40 mA. The specic surface area, pore volume, and pore size of catalysts  were  measured  using  a  Micromeritics  ASAP  2020  surface  area  and  porosity analyzer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out  using a Diamond TG-DTA/Spectrum GX, and the temperature range was  40  ◦ C to 800  ◦ C at a rate of 10  ◦ C/min under constant O 2  ow.

    "paragraph": "29,  31,  52-53  Stock solutions for  the  MOF  reagents  were  prepared,  including  0.1  M  ZrCl 4   in  dimethylformamide (DMF), 0.1 M terephthalic acid (BDC) in DMF, and  0.1M HCl in DMF. The following was  combined: 5 mL of  ZrCl 4  stock, 10 mL of BDC and 1.5 mL of HCl stock solution. The MOF solution was heated at 110 o C for 24 hours  and then the solid MOF powder was recovered via vacuum filtration and washing with DMF followed by Methanol. The MOF  solid was activated  by drying  under  vacuum at 120 o C overnight. UiO-66 MOF powder was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), N 2  adsorption measurements and  thermal  gravimetric  analysis  (TGA)  (see  supporting  information).   2.3 Fabrication of neat Matrimid ®  flat sheet membranes.   Matrimid ®  (0.4 g) was cast as a dense membrane by first  dissolving  it in 3 g of DMF,  after  which  it  was  left  static  for 1 hour to eliminate air bubbles from the solution. The  Matrimid ®  dope solution was then drop cast onto a 3-inch  Pyrex  petri  dish  and  heated  to  110 o C  for  24  hours.  The  Matrimid ®   membrane  was  then  solvent  exchanged  with  methanol  using  Soxhlet  Extraction  for  2  days  and  then  heated  at 100 o C for  24 hours under vacuum, followed by  heating at 340 o C for  4 hours. Neat  Matrimid ®  films  were  characterized  using  TGA,  and  gas  permeance  measurements (see supporting information).   2.4 Fabrication of MMMs with in-situ MOF growth.  Nano-UiO-66 synthesis involves combining precursors in  a  DMF  solution  at  elevated  temperature.  Therefore,  we  chose to fabricate MMMs using our new approach with a  glassy polymer that is stable at those synthesis conditions.  Matrimid ®   is  soluble  in  DMF,  and  is  thermally  stable  to  ~400 o C. Three different MMMs were fabricated with MOF  loadings of 2, 5, and 11 wt% in Matrimid ® . MMMs with 2  and 5 wt% MOF loading were prepared by dissolving 0.4 g  of Matrimid ®  in a portion of the 16.5 mL MOF solution (as  described  in  Section 2.2). MMMs with  2 wt% MOF were  prepared by dissolving Matrimid ®  in 1 g of MOF solution,  with 2 g  of DMF. MMMs with a 5 wt% MOF used 3 g of  MOF solution to dissolve the polymer. For MMMs with 11  wt% MOF, a higher concentration of MOF precursor solution was prepared consisting of 0.15 M ZrCl 4  in DMF, and  0.15 M BDC in DMF. Then, 5 mL of 0.15 M ZrCl 4  stock was  combined with 10 mL of 0.15 M BDC stock and 1.5 mL of  0.1  M  HCl  stock.  The  11  wt%  MMM  dope  solution  was  then  prepared by  dissolving  0.4 g of Matrimid ®   in 3  g of  concentrated  MOF  solution  with  an  additional  0.5  g  of  DMF.  Once  dissolved,  all  MMM  solutions  (2,  5,  and  11  wt%) were drop cast into 3-inch Pyrex petri dishes. MMM  solutions with 2 and 5 wt% MOF were heated in an oven  at 110 o C for 24 hours, while the 11 wt% solution was heated  at  100 o C  for  24  hours.  The  DMF  in  the  MMM  solution  slowly evaporated as the MOF forms and the clear yellow  MMM  solution  transformed  into  an  opaque  yellow  film.  The  11  wt%  MOF  MMM  formed  a  uniform  film  using  a  slightly lower reaction temperature as compared to the 2  and 5 wt% MOF MMMs. Above 100 o C, MMMs with 11 wt%  MOF had some defects and were brittle. All MMMs were  solvent  exchanged  with  methanol  using  Soxhlet  extraction for 2 days and then heated at 100 o C for 24 hours under vacuum, followed by heating at 340 o C for 4 hours. All  MMMs  were  characterized  by  powder  XRD,  SEM,  TGA,  and  gas  permeation  measurements  (see  supporting  information).  2.5 Fabrication of MMMs using post-synthesis MOF mixing.  MMMs with 3, 6, and 10 wt% UiO-66 were prepared using  traditional post-synthesis mixing techniques of MOF and  the polymer dope solution. First a polymer dope solution  was prepared by dissolving 0.4 g of Matrimid ®  in chloroform. Then UiO-66 MOF particles, synthesized according  to Section 2.2,  were  dispersed in chloroform  using  ultrasonication. Next, UiO-66 particles were primed by adding  30%  of  the  total  polymer  dope  solution  to  the  MOF/chloroform  mixture,  and  then  were  roller  mixed  and sonicated  for 2 hours. The rest  of  the polymer dope  solution was added slowly in two more steps, with roller  mixing  and  sonication  performed  after  each  step.

The terephthalic acid (H 2 bdc) solution was prepared with 22.5 g of H 2 bdc, 4.05 L of DMF, and 450 mL of formic acid, while the ZrOCl 2 ·8H 2 O was prepared with 45 g of ZrOCl 2 · 8H 2 O in 4.5 L of DMF. The reaction procedure is as follows (Figure S1). An initial 100 mL of the ZrOCl 2 ·8H 2 O solution was added to a 5 L round-bottom ﬂask at 120 °C, then both the ZrOCl 2 ·8H 2 O (mM) and H 2 bdc stock solution were separately delivered with feed rate of 12 mL/min for 5 min. The feed rate was accelerated to 32 mL/min for 55 min. After this ﬁrst addition, 2.5 L of the reaction solution was removed from the reactor to obtain the ﬁrst product, UiO-66 80 , and then 1.5 L of metal stock solution and 1.5 L of ligand stock solution were further added into the remaining reaction solution at 30 mL/ min for 50 min. Then 3 L of reaction solution was collected form the reactor to obtain the second product, UiO-66 120 . Finally, 1.55 L of metal stock solution and 1.55 L of ligand stock solution were added into the reactor within 1 h at 25.8 mL/min, and the remaining reaction solution (3.7 L) was collected as the third product UiO66 250 .

The obtained solution was loaded into a 100 mL Teflon-lined steel autoclave and then placed in a preheated oven at 120 °C for 24 h under static conditions. The UiO-66nTi MOFs (n represents the mass fraction of Ti 4+ ) were synthesized by following the same procedure but with varying amounts of Ti 4+ being added (titanium isopropoxide was used as the Ti 4+ precursor). The selected molar ratios of Ti/Zr were 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 30%. After crystallization, the white products were collected by centrifugation, thoroughly washed with DMF and methanol, and then dried overnight under vacuum at 60 °C.",

For synthesis of modulated UiO-66, the organic acid, benzoic acid or formic acid, was then added. The mixture was sonicated until all solutes dissolved, and then heated at 393 K in an oil bath for 48 or 72 h. Crystals were collected with a centrifuge at 8,500 rpm for 5 min, followed by washing with fresh acetone three times to extract the unreacted precursors and solvent. The collected crystals were dried in an oven at 333 K overnight to remove residual acetone. Before characterization and any other analysis, samples were activated at 190 °C under vacuum for 24 h to remove any residual species.Characterization. Activated UiO-66 crystals were characterized by powder X-ray diﬀraction (PXRD), nitrogen physisorption, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and solution 1 H NMR. PXRD measurements were performed on an X’ Pert Pro P ANalytical X-ray diﬀractometer in reﬂection (Bragg− Brentano) geometry operating with a Cu anode at 45 kV and 40 mA. PXRD patterns were collected with a step size of 0.017° 2θ and scan time of 10 s/step. Surface area and pore volume/size analysis was estimated using nitrogen physisorption isotherms collected at 77 K using a BET surface area analyzer (BELSORP-max, Microtrac). BET surface areas were calculated in individually determined pressure ranges as summarized in the Supporting Information. To determine the chemical composition of synthesized UiO-66 samples, TGA and solution 1 H NMR of UiO-66 adsorbents were conducted with TGA Q500 (TA Instruments) and with Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer, respectively.",

In this work, the UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH 2 were prepared and ﬁrstly explored for U(VI) capture from aqueous solution. The prepared UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH 2 were characterized by XRD, FT-IR, N 2 sorption and TGA. The effectiveness of these two MOFs for U(VI) sorption was assessed. The effect of various parameters such as contact time, pH, ion strength and initial U(VI) concentration on the sorption, as well as the selectivity of the sorbents for U(VI) were investigated in detail.

Then,  autoclave was sealed and heated to 120 °C and let to crystallize for 24 h. The light yellow precipitate was observed. The  solvent exchange was preformed with DMF (2 × 30 ml) and  then with EtOH (2 × 30 ml). The precipitate was separated  from the supernatant by ﬁltration, and the residual solvent  was removed in vacuum at 120 °C for overnight.",
